SERVICES Student research mentoring and connecting students to researchers Consultation on study design Grant writing assistance Statistical assistance Guidance with Institutional Review Board (IRB) applications and approval Resources for potential funding mechanisms Ask a Biostatistician Kayéromi Gomez, PhD, Biostatistician The biostatistician position is new to the UICOMR campus. As Biostatistician for the Office of Research, Dr. Kayéromi Gomez provides support and assistance to faculty and students who are conducting research in the College of Medicine and the College of Pharmacy in the areas of study design, data analysis and interpretation of results. The purpose of the “ Ask a Biostatistician ” form is to provide a venue for medical and pharmacy students and faculty the opportunity to ask Dr. Gomez a biostatistics or research question that may need a quick answer. In this way, students and faculty are not limited to having to meet in-person on certain dates and times with Dr. Gomez to get help. If more in-depth help is needed, please email Dr. Gomez ( [email protected] ) to schedule a meeting to discuss your biostatistics/research needs. Ask a Biostatistician Form PROGRAMS James Scholar Program – The James Scholar Program is an honors program targeting the top 25% of medical students.  Over the course of three years, selected students, in partnership with a faculty research mentor, pursue and complete an independent research project based on their unique interests.  Students are allotted a small budget for research expenses as well as travel costs associated with presenting their project at a national conference.  Annually, 30 to 35 medical students participate in the program. Research Day – Research Day is held annually on the UIC Health Sciences Campus-Rockford. The event highlights the research and scholarly activities of students, residents and faculty of the College of Medicine and affiliated partners.  Research Day is coordinated by the College of Medicine Rockford committee on research. Student & Resident Research Travel Award – The Student & Resident Travel Award is awarded to a medical student or resident who is presenting as a first author at a national conference.  Up to $1,000 in reimbursement in conference registration and travel expenses. Walter Rice Craig Fellowship – The Walter Rice Craig Fellowship Program enables two medical students to engage in research under the guidance of a University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford (UICOMR) faculty member the summer between their M1 and M2 year.  The research must be conducted at UICOMR.  Students are eligible to receive a $2,700 stipend and are expected to work on their project during the summer months.  Students will present their project at the UICOMR’s annual Research Day. FUNDING MECHANISMS Bridge Funding – Bridge funding is intended to provide short term financial support to sustain the research programs, laboratories, and momentum of productive researchers during funding gaps to give them a chance to regain extramural funding.  Bridge funding is targeted to all members of the faculty of the College of Medicine Rockford who have established projects that demonstrate high probability of securing extramural funding. Bridge Funding Guidelines Basic Research Bridge Funding Application Clinical, Educational & Community Health Research Grant – The purpose of the Clinical, Educational and Community Health Research Grant is to fund clinical, educational, and community research that will improve health care delivery or expand the body of knowledge in an area of clinical research, educational research and/or improve the health of the community.  The program is also intended to foster collaboration across disciplines, among faculty and students and with community organizations.  (We understand this may vary greatly depending upon the project.)  The types of projects sought are those that will provide the foundation for development of larger grants and/or develop, enhance, or expand clinical, educational or community research.  These grants are available to both faculty and students.
