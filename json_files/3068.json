At its core, industrial engineering is about improving processes.  Industrial engineers develop an ability to spot inefficiencies and fix them. They know how to optimize.  How? They have completed a course of study—like the one we offer here at UIC—that gives them a command of analytics, applications, logistics, and systems. An industrial engineering degree gives you the ability to gather and process data, integrate it all into \"the big picture,\" and come up with solutions that allow people to work better, faster, and smarter.       Learn about our IE curriculum         Undergraduate (BS)            Master's (MS)              Doctoral (PhD)          What do industrial engineers do?  Industrial engineering acts like a large umbrella, under which you'll find an incredible variety of career paths. Maybe you are interested in systems design. Perhaps you want to improve healthcare. Maybe you're captivated by manufacturing. These are just a few of the things that industrial engineers can do. Common career choices include:     Systems engineering   Use a process of discovery and exploration to devise the best possible system to meet a need or perform a desired function.     Supply chain management   Oversee the sourcing of raw materials and their transformation into goods and services that people use everyday.     Artificial intelligence   Explore ways to apply artificial intelligence to familiar processes so that those processes lead to better, more accurate outcomes.     Advanced manufacturing   Determine the optimal ways to create products for all sectors—including things used by consumers and things used by industry.     Data analytics   Harness the power of data to help people make more informed decisions about what to do and how to do it.     Healthcare   Come up with systems that make it easier for doctors, nurses, and other providers to do their jobs, leading to better care for patients.     Financial technology   Use analytical and mathematical tools to address financial issues, devise innovative financial products, and identify good investments.     Safety engineering   Ensure that systems across a wide variety of industries are safe for people to use and behave as needed even when a component fails.     Human factors   Engineer and​ design products, processes, and systems based on your understanding of human psychological and physiological characteristics.              Industrial engineers are in demand.  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that industrial engineering jobs are projected to grow by 8 percent by 2028—faster than the average for all occupations—as firms across industries seek new ways to contain costs and improve efficiency.
