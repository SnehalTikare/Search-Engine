The campus strives to achieve the goals of diversity and inclusion which are consistent across campuses while working locally to implement programs which support this agenda. The Assistant Dean for Diversity in Rockford is Pedro Rodriguez, MD. Dr. Rodriguez works closely with the Associate Dean for Diversity and Inclusion at the College of Medicine, Dr. William Walden who is to be replaced in the fall by Dr. Gloria Elam. The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford is pleased to announce that Pedro Rodriguez, MD, has joined our faculty as Assistant Dean of Diversity and Inclusion. In this role, Dr. Rodriguez will lead efforts to further support a diverse and inclusive culture on campus. While serving as an advisor to the Dean and department heads regarding diversity, he will also work with educational leaders to develop curricula that address cultural competence and its impact on patient care. “We are delighted to have Dr. Rodriguez drive the initiatives and programs to cultivate a climate of diversity and equity in which individual students, faculty, and staff feel welcomed, valued for their contributions, and feel their identities can be openly expressed,” said Dr. Alex Stagnaro-Green, Dean of the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford. “We are an academic medical center committed to developing an optimal learning environment for training healthcare professionals, conducting innovative research, and dedicated to improving the health and wellness of our society. Dr. Rodriguez’s experience and educational background make him an excellent addition to our faculty and we are excited to have him drive our efforts to recruit and retain faculty to improve and expand diversity and inclusion.” Additionally, Dr. Rodriguez will work with the Offices of Student and Academic Affairs in addressing issues of climate for diverse student populations.
