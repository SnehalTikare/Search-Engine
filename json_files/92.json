Resources for Students (Compiled by colleagues in the Office of the Dean of Students and the Office of Diversity)  UIC cares about you. These past few weeks have brought a great deal of changes as we endeavor to flatten the curve and limit the spread of COVID-19. These changes can cause stress, and you may have questions and need support. Your UIC family is here for you and is so proud of you.

Online Collections and Resources  We encourage you to access our many collections and services online. The Library subscribes to tens of thousands of online resources that can be searched through our Library website at library.uic.edu Hundreds of research guides provide information about specific disciplinary resources as well as about issues such as copyright, which may be on your mind as you move your courses online. In addition, many publishers and vendors are increasing access to their offerings during this crisis.  Publishers have made selected electronic resources temporarily open access to aid online instruction and research during the COVID-19 emergency so that educators and researchers can use them easily as they adapt their courses online. The UIC University Library will continue to add new resources to this list as they become available. Please visit this page often for the latest updates.
