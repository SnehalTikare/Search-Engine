The Sustainability Internship Program (SIP) is a multi-year program that starts with a for-credit (US/PUBH 390) spring course.  SIP offers an internship placement at a UIC department or affiliated organization, weekly seminars, field outings that cover a range of educational and skill building topics, leadership development and project management experience.  Spring 2020 syllabus can be found here .     What are the Seminars?   Seminar topics include environmental, cultural, and energy sustainability issues,  institutional challenges and change management, campus structure and administration, campus sustainability programs, and job readiness.     Intern Expectations   Interns are expected to develop a work plan and project goals, meet regularly with an experienced mentor, share experiences with other SIP interns, attend weekly seminars and outings, and present their project results at a poster presentation.     Spring Internship Program   The spring internship is a for-credit class held during the semester (US/PUBH390); in addition to a weekly 1.25 hour seminar, students are required to commit approximately eight (8) hour a week to their assigned internship.
