Laptops are easily lost, and even desktop computers can be stolen. PGP Desktop Encryption also includes a secure shredder, to really delete files you want to delete.

What are PGP and Public and Private Keys?  What are common issues with encryption?  More…            Features   The UIC license for PGP Desktop centers on PGP Whole-Drive Encryption, which securely encrypts the entire contents of your laptop or desktop, including boot sectors, system, and swap files. After you install PGP Desktop on your computer it will automatically encrypt the hard drive. After your hard disk is encrypted, you must log in to Symantec before you can boot the computer with a passphrase that you create. Operating system login bypass tricks won’t work. PGP Desktop offers:   Encryption for all files and folders stored on your personal computer  Digital signatures for any of the above, which prove both the origin of the material and that it has not been altered  “PGP Shredder”, a secure delete program that completely deletes files by overwriting the data you want to delete with random text multiple times. In contrast, a normal file deletion done by an operating system only removes a file’s name from the disk directory; its data remains on the disk until something else is written over it            More Info   PGP User Guides  Download PGP User Guides from Symantec  Requirements  A computer will need to meet the system requirements in order to run PGP Desktop.  System: Note that the operating system requirements for the installers we have at UIC may be slightly different from those listed there on Symantec’s page. Specifically, the newest operating systems currently supported are Windows 10 (version 1809) and macOS 10.14 (Mojave).  For Windows machines, please see the following page for system requirements and compatibility for the latest version of the client (10.4.2 MP1): http://symantec.com/docs/TECH248332  For machines running MacOS, please see the following page for requirements and compatibility for the latest version of the client (10.4.2 MP1 HF1): http://symantec.com/docs/TECH248333  NOTE:  Older Symantec Mac clients (10.4.0 or earlier) are not compatible with CoreStorage. If you are using Symantec client version 10.4.0 or earlier and have upgraded to OS X 10.10 from an earlier version, you may need to disable “CoreStorage”.  New installations should have this feature disabled by default. To disable CoreStorage, please follow the steps found here: https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWTO109622.html .  Also, if using a version 10.4.0 client with OS X 10.11 “El Capitan”, the SIP feature must first be disabled. Please see the following link for instructions on how to disable this feature: https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.TECH235027.html .  Client: The oldest Symantec client software that we still support is version 10.4.  To download the latest version please visit the U of I WebStore .  The ACCC is running a Symantec Encryption Management Server, in which your Symantec key is protected with your UIC Active Directory ID and password, which is your UIC NetID and your ACCC common password.  A typical computer using Symantec will need two things both available for no charge through the online Webstore:   Symantec Encryption Management Server license, 1 per person  Symantec Encryption Desktop, 1 per machine               Google Maps image     C-Stop, BSB   1007 West Harrison Street,  Behavioral Sciences Building (BSB), Learning Center, First Floor,  Chicago,  IL    Phone: (312) 413-0003  Website: https://accc.uic.edu/support         Service Level Agreement       Service Request Fulfillment Time  In Development    Incident Resolution Time  In Development    Service Availability  In Development    Maintenance Window(s)  In Development    Service Notification Channel(s)  In Development    Reviewed to Ensure SLA Meets Business Requirements  In Development    Date Reviewed  In Development    Service Owner: Ed Zawacki               Services           Communication and Collaboration     Cloud Storage     Box    Google Drive    OneDrive      Conferencing     Blackboard Collaborate    Google Meet    Webex Meetings    Zoom      Digital Signage     Industry Weapon      Email and Calendaring     Exchange    Gmail    Google Calendar    Listserv      Emergency Communications     Startel    UIC Alert      Instant Messaging     Jabber      Phone Services     Automatic Call Distribution    Mobile Devices    Telephones    Voicemail      Productivity Software     G Suite    Office 365      Virtual Collaboration Spaces     Google Chat    Microsoft Teams      Website Services     Google Sites    Microsoft IIS    People.uic.edu    SharePoint    Webhost.uic.edu        Computing Services     Device Charging     Recharge Stations      Endpoint Management     Jamf    SCCM      Printing     U-Print    Wepa      Software Licensing and Sales     Software Licensing        Infrastructure     Backups     ADSM    CrashPlan      Cloud Computing     Azure      Colocation Server Hosting     Data Center      Database Services     MS SQL    MySQL      Network     Data Jacks    Domain Name System    Guest Wireless    Residence Hall Network    Virtual Private Network    Wired Network    Wireless Network      Storage     Active Directory Desktop Advantage    Active Directory Network Storage      Virtual Machines     Linux Virtual Machine    Windows Virtual Machine        Professional Services     Desktop Support     Contracted Support    Hourly Service Calls      Device Maintenance     Personal Device Maintenance      Event Support     Event Support (Audio/Visual)      IT Memberships     Corporate Executive Board    Educause    Gartner    REACH      Professional Development and Training     AVIXA    Online Training    Webinars and Workshops      Ticketing System     Request Tracker        Research     Research Computing     High Performance Computing    Secure Computing Environment      Research Networks     High-Performance Research Network      Surveys for Research     Qualtrics        Security     Account Administration     NetID Activation    UIC Account Portal      Antivirus     Symantec Endpoint Protection    System Center Endpoint Protection      Authentication     2-Factor Authentication    Active Directory    Bluestem    Shibboleth Framework      Certificates     SSL/TLS Certificates      Directory Services     Active Directory    DeptUpdate    Online Directory      Encryption     Bitlocker    PGP Desktop      Event Logging     Splunk      Identity Management     Affiliations    UIN      Password Management     NetID Password Manager    Secondary NetID Password Manager      Role-Based Authorization     Liaison Manager    PbUpdate        Teaching and Learning     Active Learning Systems     Echo360 Engagement    iClicker    Poll Everywhere    Wireless Collaboration and Presentation      Anti-Plagiarism     iThenticate    SafeAssign      eLearning Authoring    Equipment Lending     Extended Laptop Loan    Short-Term Lending      Learning Environments     Classrooms    Computer Labs      Learning Management System     Blackboard Learn      Lecture Capture     Echo360 Platform    Panopto      Media Streaming     Echo360 Platform    Google Drive    Panopto      Multimedia Production     Lightboard Studio    Media Conversion      Online Proctoring     Respondus      Surveys     Blackboard Surveys    Google Forms                        ",
