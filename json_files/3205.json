The mini-profiles below offer a few examples of the thousands of rewarding careers pursued by alumni of UIC’s undergraduate programs in bioengineering and bioinformatics.       Nicholas Marjanovic, BS ’15      Chief Technology Officer  HideIt Wearables  What’s great about your job? Being able to work on a problem that pops up during design and then apply the engineering process to come up with an awesome solution. Having something finally work after dedicating so many hours or days tackling it is the best feeling ever!  How do you hope your work will create positive change in the world? I hope my work will allow individuals with disabilities to seamlessly connect and interact with the digital world around them.  What was your favorite course? Bioengineering 431 , a class dedicated to teaching you hands-on about electronic components and how they are used to build systems of devices.  Why did you choose UIC? UIC is a one-of-a-kind institution with a small-town feel where everyone is welcome to work with one another to tackle all issues presented. I chose UIC because it has the reputation of a top engineering school with all the assets available to guarantee success.       Ryan Orda, BS ’15      Research and Development Engineer Abbott Laboratories  What’s great about your job? Getting to see the full scope of a project and the direct impact of the work.  What do you hope to be doing 10 years from now? I hope to continue advancing the technology of the medical-device industry and eliminate the problems and limitations of today.  Is there an aspect of studying in Chicago in particular that you feel benefited you? The ease of accessing a diverse set of resources was hugely beneficial.  What was your favorite course? My favorite course was Interdisciplinary Product Development .  Coolest thing you’ve done in the past year: I had an opportunity to travel to Barcelona to collaborate with a third party on development of a new medical instrument for Abbott.
