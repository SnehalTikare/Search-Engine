Lab efforts are to better understand the sensory-motor system through close interaction with artificial systems and machines. Specifically, Dr. Patton is interested in leveraging our knowledge of how the brain acquires, organizes and executes motor behaviors to solve problems not only in rehabilitation but in other endeavors that present challenges to the neuromotor system.
