I am particularly interested in \nlayout optimization, logic synthesis, programmable \ndevices and timing optimization.  I also have an interest in \nbridging so-called ``optimization disconnects''\n between traditionally sequential design phases (e.g., between\nlogic synthesis and physical design).\n\nThis work is essentially applied\n combinatorial optimization and so I have a natural interst in\nareas such as local\nsearch, Integer Linear Programming, optimality studies, and lower bounding\ntechniques.  email: lillis@uic.edu   Office: 908 SEO (Science and Engineering Building)  Office Hours:  see calendar below; also available by appointment  Phone: (312) 355-1317  Dept Phone/Fax: (312) 996-3423 / 413-0024  Dept of CS (MC 152) U. of Illinois, Room 1120 SEO 851 S.
