Electrical and computer engineers have the opportunity to make an extraordinary impact on the world around us.  That is because nearly every aspect of our lives is touched by electrical and computer technology. These fields help to determine how long your phone battery lasts, how the light in your bedroom can be connected to your smart watch, how robots assemble the products you use every day, how autonomous vehicles drive themselves, and more.  You get the picture: life as we know it today would not be possible without the knowledge, skills, and innovative thinking of electrical and computer engineers.  ECE, as we call it, is one cohesive department at UIC, but it houses three majors—any one of which can be the start of an extremely rewarding career. Consider these options:      ECE Majors        Computer Engineering  Computer engineers devise the systems that make modern computing technology possible.          Electrical Engineering  Electrical engineering covers a range of areas, from electromagnetics, nanotechnologyto renewable energy.          Engineering Physics  Engineering physics combines the strengths of a hard science (physics) with the applied approach of engineering.           ECE career points to know        $111,700   Top range of the median salary for U.S. electrical and computer engineers.         19 %   Anticipated growth in computer engineering jobs between 2015 and 2024.           Career Paths in ECE   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, professionals in electrical engineering, electronics engineering, and computer hardware engineering—all fields that stem from an ECE education—reported a median annual salary of $93,000 to $111,700.  Here in Illinois, according to state data, the number of computer engineering jobs is slated to grow by 19 percent in the decade leading up to 2022, with about 5 percent job growth in electrical and electronics engineering.  These are just some of the careers that our department can prepare you for:   Aviation electronics engineering  Broadcast electronics engineering  Communications systems engineering  Computer hardware engineering  Design engineering  Electrical engineering  Implementation engineering  Nanotechnology  Network engineering  Process engineering  Quality control  Radar technology  Software engineering  Systems engineering and testing  User experience (UX) design and development  Wireless systems engineering   The Engineering Career Center helps UIC undergraduates to chart their course in these and other fields.
