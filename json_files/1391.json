An important function of REACH is to allow the ACCC to keep in better contact with departmental needs. If your computing needs are changing, or if you find yourself seeking new options, the REACH members will let us know that our support focus must change, also. All members have agreed to share their knowledge with their colleagues, or if they don't know an answer, to at least point people to the appropriate ACCC support service.  A member might be faculty, staff, or student; they might be employed for computer support, but they could also be a volunteer.

How can we refer faculty/staff to ACCC On-Site Support or REACH contacts for technical support?  More…            More Info   Search for your department’s REACH contact  Use the following link to get a department listing that will have REACH members, PBContacts, and other departmental contacts: liaison.uic.edu .  To perform the search of REACH members for your department, log in and then enter the appropriate information for: Select Campus Unit / Select DNS Zone / Enter NetID or UIN  Designate REACH contacts  Each department head has been asked to nominate someone to join REACH. Most departments have one member although a few active departments have two. If your department doesn’t have a REACH member, your department head can appoint one, directly on the web. We ask that each member be nominated by the department head, both to keep the size of REACH manageable, and to make sure the REACH member has implicit approval to spend time on REACH duties:  REACH Nomination Page (for authorized department heads only; see above)  REACH wiki (authentication required)             Service Level Agreement       Service Request Fulfillment Time  In Development    Incident Resolution Time  In Development    Service Availability  In Development    Maintenance Window(s)  In Development    Service Notification Channel(s)  In Development    Reviewed to Ensure SLA Meets Business Requirements  In Development    Date Reviewed  In Development    Service Owner: Mark Goedert               Services           Communication and Collaboration     Cloud Storage     Box    Google Drive    OneDrive      Conferencing     Blackboard Collaborate    Google Meet    Webex Meetings    Zoom      Digital Signage     Industry Weapon      Email and Calendaring     Exchange    Gmail    Google Calendar    Listserv      Emergency Communications     Startel    UIC Alert      Instant Messaging     Jabber      Phone Services     Automatic Call Distribution    Mobile Devices    Telephones    Voicemail      Productivity Software     G Suite    Office 365      Virtual Collaboration Spaces     Google Chat    Microsoft Teams      Website Services     Google Sites    Microsoft IIS    People.uic.edu    SharePoint    Webhost.uic.edu        Computing Services     Device Charging     Recharge Stations      Endpoint Management     Jamf    SCCM      Printing     U-Print    Wepa      Software Licensing and Sales     Software Licensing        Infrastructure     Backups     ADSM    CrashPlan      Cloud Computing     Azure      Colocation Server Hosting     Data Center      Database Services     MS SQL    MySQL      Network     Data Jacks    Domain Name System    Guest Wireless    Residence Hall Network    Virtual Private Network    Wired Network    Wireless Network      Storage     Active Directory Desktop Advantage    Active Directory Network Storage      Virtual Machines     Linux Virtual Machine    Windows Virtual Machine        Professional Services     Desktop Support     Contracted Support    Hourly Service Calls      Device Maintenance     Personal Device Maintenance      Event Support     Event Support (Audio/Visual)      IT Memberships     Corporate Executive Board    Educause    Gartner    REACH      Professional Development and Training     AVIXA    Online Training    Webinars and Workshops      Ticketing System     Request Tracker        Research     Research Computing     High Performance Computing    Secure Computing Environment      Research Networks     High-Performance Research Network      Surveys for Research     Qualtrics        Security     Account Administration     NetID Activation    UIC Account Portal      Antivirus     Symantec Endpoint Protection    System Center Endpoint Protection      Authentication     2-Factor Authentication    Active Directory    Bluestem    Shibboleth Framework      Certificates     SSL/TLS Certificates      Directory Services     Active Directory    DeptUpdate    Online Directory      Encryption     Bitlocker    PGP Desktop      Event Logging     Splunk      Identity Management     Affiliations    UIN      Password Management     NetID Password Manager    Secondary NetID Password Manager      Role-Based Authorization     Liaison Manager    PbUpdate        Teaching and Learning     Active Learning Systems     Echo360 Engagement    iClicker    Poll Everywhere    Wireless Collaboration and Presentation      Anti-Plagiarism     iThenticate    SafeAssign      Digital Textbooks     Open Educational Resources    RedShelf    VitalSource      eLearning Authoring    Equipment Lending     Extended Laptop Loan    Short-Term Lending      Learning Environments     Classrooms    Computer Labs      Learning Management System     Blackboard Learn      Lecture Capture     Echo360 Platform    Panopto      Media Streaming     Echo360 Platform    Google Drive    Panopto      Multimedia Production     Lightboard Studio    Media Conversion      Online Proctoring     Respondus      Surveys     Blackboard Surveys    Google Forms                        ",
