When is a program extension necessary?   For students in F-1 status: a program extension is  necessary      if you plan on studying past the date in item #5, of your  current Form I-20.      Please see the date contained in the blank,  “…complete studies      not later than .”  For students in J-1 status: a program extension is necessary      if you plan on studying past the program end date in item #3 of your Form      DS-2019.   The end date listed on either Form I-20 or DS-2019 is considered  the “expiration”    date of your immigration status. If you do not apply  for a program extension    and you remain in the US, you will be  considered to be in violation of your    immigration status.  How to apply  Submit the following documentation to OIS at least 30-60 days prior    to the expiration of your status:   Obtain a letter recommending a program extension from your Academic  Advisor,      Dean, Director of Graduate Studies, or Department Head  (see sample letter      below).  Gather financial documents to show that you can support yourself (and any      dependents) for the entire period of the extension. OIS requires original      copies of financial documents, which are not more than six (6) months      old . Financial documentation might include one or more of the following:  Bank statement  Bank letter  Proof of assistantship and/or tuition waiver    Complete the “ Program Extension Form \".   The following is a summary of account types we do accept:  All summary of account statements must be valid no later than   six months upon receipt, and must be signed and/or stamped by bank   official   Savings Accounts: all forms of savings accounts will be accepted, including demand deposit, current accounts and money market.

Provident Funds : the amount available for withdrawal must be stated in the letter  Education Loans : it must be evident that the person is pre-approved or approved for the loan  Scholarship Award Letters : must clearly state  what  the scholarship includes, such as tuition, fees, and books.  If  the  scholarship includes a stipend, it must state the dollar amount per   month.   The following is a summary of account types we do not accept:   Retirement Funds  Insurance Policies  Foreign Exchange  Business Accounts  Stock Market Funds , including mutual funds, equity funds/accounts, and yield funds.  Demat Accounts: are used for the trade of stocks, securities, and debentures.

New/extended end date: The new immigration document  will      show that your program has been extended to a date that was  based on the completion      date stated by your Academic Advisor, Dean,  Director of Graduate Studies or      Department Head. Keep in mind that  if you complete your program of studies before the new expiration date listed on your form,      then your grace  period (if eligible) will begin from your program completion      date, not the date listed on the extended I-20/DS-2019.      By the end date of your grace period you have the following options:  leave the country  apply for work authorization  transfer to a new academic program/institution  change immigration status  in some other way maintain your legal status in the U.S.    Grace periods: Immigration allows a grace period  for international      students who have maintained their status during  their program. This is considered      to be time for you to prepare for  your departure from the US. This grace period      begins the day you  complete your program of study. F-1s receive 60-days and      J-1s  receive 30-days.   Sample letter of recommendation for an F-1 program extension (Must be on department letterhead.)
