Illinois at Chicago, USA  The Semantic Web is a key initiative being promoted by the World Wide Web Consortium\n\t\t\t(W3C) as the next generation of the current web. Machine-understandable metadata is emerging as a new foundation\n\t\t\tfor component-based approaches to application development. Within the context of reusable distributed components,\n\t\t\tWeb services represent the latest architectural advancement. Such concepts can be synthesized providing powerful\n\t\t\tnew mechanisms for quickly modeling, creating and deploying complex applications that readily adapt to real world\n\t\t\tneed.  The objective of this workshop is to present database and information system research as they relate to the Semantic\n\t\t\tWeb and more broadly, to gain insight into the Semantic Web technology as it relates to databases and information\n\t\t\tsystems.   Topics of interest include but are not limited to:   Infrastructure: component models\n\t\t\t(e.g., J2EE, .NET); distributed object-based architectures; scalability, extensibility and robustness of applications;\n\t\t\talgebras for modeling and ontology management; creation, maintenance and versioning of annotations, metadata and\n\t\t\tmappings; tools (including visual tools) for creating components (e.g., ontologies, mappings, views, etc.); workflow\n\t\t\tsystems, web services and quality of service contracts; support for negotiation and trust; security.   Semantics : conceptual clustering\n\t\t\tand statistical approaches; social networks and consensus analysis approaches; information analysis accuracy (e.g.,\n\t\t\tprecision, recall, false positives); ontologies, conceptual models, taxonomies; semantic interoperability and integration;\n\t\t\tsemantic composition of web services; view definition and transformations (e.g., global/local as view); query algebras\n\t\t\tfor combined data and metadata queries; semantics-based query relaxation techniques, loss of information; logic\n\t\t\tbased (centralized and distributed) inferences; intensional query answering; emergent semantics.   Applications: Semantic Web applications\n\t\t\t(prototypes, pilots, deployed) based on XML, RDF, and various variants; web services based applications (prototypes,\n\t\t\tpilots, deployed) based on WSDL, SOAP, UDDI, ebXML and other related standards; natural language processing; semantics-based\n\t\t\tintegration of data/applications within enterprises; geographical information systems; bio-informatics; business\n\t\t\taspects for Semantic Web applications (e.g., return of investment, sustainable business models).
