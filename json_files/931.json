Some of the options below are free of charge, and some of them are free trial periods, requiring entry of a credit card, which could result in payment drafting once the trial period ends. Please be aware, these options are only suggestions for assisting in remaining physically active during a time period where access to traditional fitness centers and equipment may be unavailable.  Participation in Group Fitness Classes is completely voluntary. There are risks and hazards, minor and serious, associated with participation in Group Fitness Classes. Participants voluntarily assume all responsibility and risk of loss, damage, illness, and/or injury to person or property associated with participation in Group Fitness Classes. Group Fitness Classes require a minimum level of fitness to participate safely. The Campus Recreation Department strongly advises participants to consult with their physician if they have any doubts of their physical ability to safely participate.    Check out the main Drop In group fitness page for the upcoming Drop-In Zoom classes.  Drop-In Fitness       Intramural Sports     With the stay at home order in effect and our in person sporting events currently suspended, we wanted to let you know about some leagues that you can do at home to get involved! We are excited to let you know that NEW eSports leagues are available for registration!  Join today to compete in leagues for FIFA, MADDEN NFL, NBA2K, and NHL - and all games are played at your home on your own console! These leagues will utilize 'ladder scheduling', so all players are able to compete at a day/time that works for them, and if they win, they move up the ladder! All current students, faculty, and staff are eligible to participate, so head over to IMLeagues.com to sign up for FREE and view additional league details*.
