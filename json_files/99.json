May 15, 2020: Calling for a Feminist Foreign Policy to Confront the Pandemic   In February, UIC Professor Nadine Naber joined an initiative led by the organizations MADRE, Women Cross DMZ, and Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, along with 22 women and gender nonconforming people, to engage in a cross-movement dialogue on feminist work against militarism and war in order to examine, challenge, and reimagine US foreign and domestic policy.  Professor Naber will discuss the outcome of this meeting, including a statement that calls for ending militarism in the U.S. and globally while taking seriously the impact of U.S. war abroad on indigenous, immigrant, and people of color in the U.S., especially women and gender non-conforming people.  Facilitated by Dr. Nadine Naber, professor in Gender and Women’s Studies and Global Asian Studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
