Our graduates continue with graduate work in mathematics, statistics, computer science; do graduate work in fields such as mathematics education (both research and teaching), economics, and public health; become secondary math teachers; go on to medical school, business school, and law school; and pursue careers in business, finance, actuarial science, informatics, public health, and government. Other MSCS graduates take with them their love of mathematics, their strong analytical and creative skills, and their participatory experiences in an undergraduate major that's rich with ideas into myriad new careers and pursuits, such as recording engineer, start-up entrepreneur, and educational software developer.       Awards and Scholarships for MSCS Majors   The Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science offers a number of scholarships for undergraduate and graduate students. Applications are due by 4pm, March 12.  For more information about the MSCS awards, click on the links below.   Herbert Alexander Award  Louise Hay Award  Kurtin Scholarship  Victor Twersky Memorial Scholarship  Nicholas A. Yassan Award  Kathy Hill Cawthon Award  Joseph Landin Memorial Scholarship  Damber Singh Tomer and Meena Singh Tomer Endowed International Scholarship Fund  Philip Wagreich Memorial Scholarship  Yeuk-Lam Yau-Leung Memorial Scholarship Fund   The winners are announced at the MSCS Awards Tea in late April.       LAS Awards and Scholarships   There are around 20 LAS Scholarships (ranging from 400 to 10,000 US dollars) available through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. MSCS majors and minors in good academic standing have been very competitive for these LAS awards; you are encouraged to apply.       OVCSA Awards and Scholarships   There around 10 scholarships available through the Office of the Vice Chancellor. For more information about these scholarships, go to OVCSA Scholarships .       College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Initiative   The LAS Undergraduate Research Initiative (LASURI) is a well-funded College of Liberal Arts and Sciences program that pairs Undergraduate Research Assistants with Faculty Mentors and gives these researchers or research teams funding to conduct semester- or year-long research projects.  If selected, Undergraduate Research Assistants receive a \\$2500 award (\\$1250 per semester), and Faculty Mentors receive a \\$1500 grant for project costs.  If you are already working with an MSCS professor on an ongoing research project, then you are strongly encouraged to apply for a LASURI award. If you are an MSCS undergraduate taking a 300- or 400-level course, especially a 400-level elective (like MATH 494, MCS 421, MCS 481, or an independent study), then you are especially encouraged to approach one of your professors about designing an undergraduate research project and applying for a LASURI research award.  For more information about awards and scholarships, contact your MSCS advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Studies.       Summer and Academic Year Undergraduate Research Opportunities   The American Mathematical Society maintains a list of current Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates in mathematics.  UIC provides its own Undergraduate Research Experiences . This website includes a partial list of MSCS faculty interested in taking on undergraduate students.  UREs are arranged with a faculty member and generally take place during the academic year. (See also the entry on LASURI above.)  For more information about undergraduate research experiences (REUs or UREs), contact your MSCS advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Studies.       MSCS Advising   MSCS Advising begins when announced. Remember that all MSCS majors are required to meet with an advisor before they can register for classes.  If you have any questions about your MSCS classes, our undergraduate advisors are waiting to hear from you! Contact Mary Hemby ( mtoliver@uic.edu , 312-413-2172) or Florencio Diaz ( fdiaz4@uic.edu , 312-996-3055), or the Director of Undergraduate Studies, Roman Shvydkoy ( dus@math.uic.edu ).       ALEKS Placement for Math Courses   All incoming first-year students must complete an online math assessment using ALEKS prior to taking other required UIC placement tests on campus and attending Orientation and Registration. Read more in the revised UIC Math Placement Procedures , and the ALEKS flyer .       Tips on Applying to Graduate School   If you are a junior or a senior considering continuing your education to obtain a Masters or Doctorate Degree, or if you are a new MSCS major curious about careers in Mathematics, Statistics and related fields, then we have a new must-read resource for you. Check out MSCS Careers page , along with our new Preparing for Graduate School and Careers in Mathematics brochures.
