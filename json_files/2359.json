Applications and supporting credentials should be submitted as early as possible, but no later than the published deadlines for the program to which you are applying. Applications received after the deadline will not be accepted.  Some graduate programs have application deadlines that are earlier than the University deadline, and some admit students only in specific terms (e.g. fall term only). Prospective applicants should contact the program of interest for information on current deadlines, as some programs may close earlier than the published deadlines.  Please note the following:   You must upload transcripts. Unofficial transcripts will be used to evaluate admission eligibility. If you are admitted, official transcripts will be requested at that time, along with submission instructions.  If your program requires letters of recommendation, you will need to provide email addresses for your recommenders.  Program-specific requirements (e.g. writing samples, personal statements, resumes, letters of purpose, letters of recommendation, etc.) must be submitted within the application, unless specifically directed to you otherwise by the program to which you are applying. (GRE, TOEFL, IELTS and other test scores must be sent directly from the testing service to UIC. UICâ€™s Institutional Code is 1851 for the GRE and the TOEFL).   Admission recommendations cannot be made until all required documents have been received.
