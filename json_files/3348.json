It is run by Dr. Philip Clifford, Ph.D. Associate Dean for Research, UIC College of Applied Health Sciences. Dr. Clifford has been an outspoken advocate of career and professional development for PhD scientists, and is coauthor of the widely acclaimed career website, myIDP.sciencecareers.org and an accompanying series of career planning articles in ScienceCareers. The series meets every third Thursday of each month to present a variety of career-development related topics.  To see topics and guests for past and future events in this series follow this link.        psp   Graduate College Professional Success Program (PSP)  This profession development program offered by the Graduate College incorporates seminars, workshops, and some courses into a cohesive certificate-granting program. Details about PSP can be found at this site .       idp   Individual Development Plan (IDP)  The IDP is a written list of goals that include those for the student’s research project, professional skill development and career planning. It is written and developed by the student and includes a timeline for progression towards goals. As such, it serves as a framework by which the student can discuss progress with mentor(s).  All BIOE students are expect to develop an IDP after their 2 nd year and discuss it with their advisor on an annual basis. The myIDP website should be used for development of the plan and to mediate discussion of the IDP with the students and advisor.       careerservices   Career Services – Versatile PhD  The Versatile PhD, LLC is an online resource for graduate students and postdocs who may be interested in non-academic careers.  Founded and led by Dr. Paula Chambers, this online resource provides information for PhD students and postdocs in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM disciplines. The resource can be accessed through the UIC Graduate College at this site .
