The federal government and UIC fund the program. Students interested in FWS must request it on their financial aid notifications. Students offered FWS must secure jobs on their own, hourly wages vary. To search for a FWS job, visit the Office of Student Employment website .  FWS employees are paid by direct deposit every two weeks – funds do not go towards tuition charges with the University. FWS earnings are taxable income and must be reported when filing. On the following year’s FAFSA student can indicate the amount earned from FWS and it will be subtracted from their income without decreasing eligibility for financial aid.  America Reads  The SFAS recruits literacy and math tutors for the America Reads program each year. The positions involve tutoring in family literacy centers or a Chicago Public School (CPS) site. All sites are within 3-4 miles of UIC’s east campus. Tutors earn $13.00/hour.  Eligible applicants must be:   Eligible for Federal Work Study  Available to work 10-20 hours a week  Available to work some hours between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. Monday - Friday  Able to work at least 3 hours in a row each shift  Able to speak, read, and write English fluently  Able to maintain satisfactory academic progress (2.0 GPA and 67% credit completion rate)  Enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester   Visit the SFAS reception area in the Student Services Building to request an application or download it from the forms section.
