Peer Education consist of Peer Support and Lab Tutors. Peer educators are selected by faculty through an application which is based on academic performance and interest in teaching. Each area of support is skilled at helping students identify key concepts and high yield material, as well as helping students improve study skills and test-taking strategies. Medical students are referred back to faculty for additional support, if needed. Peer Support conducts large group review sessions, small group support, and individual tutoring.
