Our students receive broad training in interdisciplinary earth science and, with faculty, conduct research that involves field work around the globe, laboratory investigations on campus and at national facilities, and computational modeling and simulations of big data. We offer three degree programs: Bachelor of Science (BS), Master of Science (MS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD). A minor in Earth and Environmental Sciences is also available to undergraduate students. We invite you to explore our programs and consider the opportunities they provide for future careers.
