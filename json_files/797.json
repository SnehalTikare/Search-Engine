The format for working groups is flexible and is determined by the faculty coordinators who must represent at least two departments. The Institute supports working groups by circulating materials, funding outside speakers, publicizing events, and providing modest refreshments for meeting and lectures.     Central & Eastern European Jewish Studies   Central & Eastern European Jewish Studies will identify and discuss theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of Jewish history and culture in the modern period in its diverse intersections with European and global socio-cultural and historical trends.     Dance, Theater, and Performance Studies   Dance, Theater, and Performance Studies will offer events that apply a theoretical and critical lens both to the art of theatre-making and to the performative practices of everyday life.     Dissertation Writing   The Interdisciplinary  Dissertation Writing  Workshop is open to ALL students and faculty, and we are eager to hear from all graduate students in the humanities who are at a point in their writing when a congenial audience of fellow scholars would be helpful in the writing process.     Engaged Humanities   Engaged Humanities  is connected with the Mellon-Funded Engaged Humanities Initiative. At regularly scheduled meetings, all interested faculty and students discuss readings, propose speakers, and address future goals for the initiative.     Global Migration   A follow-up to the Immigration Working Group, The Global Migration Working Group  will debate and explore from within an interdisciplinary lens important aspects of migration affecting the life and well-being of migrants, refugees and stateless persons in the United States and, more broadly, the overall dynamics of migration in the Western Hemisphere.     Imagining Peace in the 21st Century   Imagining Peace in the 21st Century  seeks to engage in a reflection on the social and historical relevance of peace processes. Our goal is to develop a broad debate that captures discussions both at the academic and political level. Faculty and students from any disciple are most welcome to join this conversation.     Institutions   Institutions  explores the status of institutions in different areas of contemporary public life, in the face of forces of privatization as well as political and artistic trends that have disfavored conventional modes of power and practice.     The Mesoamerican Worldview and Intellectual Tradition   The goal of The Mesoamerican Worldview and Intellectual Tradition  is to deepen our engagement of Mesoamerican philosophy in order to better understand the strength and endurance of this culture in the face of enormous social and cultural shifts.     Political Ecologies: Nature, Place, Heritage   Political Ecologies: Nature, Place, Heritage offers a cross-disciplinary platform for faculty and students interested in social movements, biodiversity, ecological activism, human rights, cultural heritage, environmental justice, and public humanities. It responds to a desire for engagement and collaboration with local communities in the global contexts of development.     Race & U.S. Empire   Race & U.S. Empire focuses on the ways that racism and capitalism inform the logics and practices of the contemporary U.S. empire both within the U.S. and across the globe. Much of our scholarship revolves around two themes: the expansion of the security state and struggles against imperial racism.     Religion in the World   Religion in the World aims to foster an interdisciplinary scholarly community dedicated to analyzing cutting edge developments in religious studies through common readings and speaker visits.     See Next   SEE NEXT – Seminar: East European and Northern Eurasian Crosstalk. This group brings together scholarswho study history and culture of Eastern Europe and Northern Eurasia.  Invited speakers will frame particular cases within wider methodological, disciplinary, and geographical contexts relevant for a broad community of students of diversity, complex societies, imperial formations and postcoloniality.
