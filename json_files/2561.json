These projects include \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tresearch-oriented activities in support of funded faculty research projects as \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twell as some projects that are just plain fun and educational. ( VRUPL is \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta satellite lab of the world renowned Electronic \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVisualization Laboratory , developers of the CAVE. )  Just like the VRUPL lab itself, this web site is still in the early \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstages of development, and will hopefully contain more information as the lab \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrows and prospers.
