Yes, findings can still be published, and\ndisclosure to your OTM does not alter your\npublication timetable. However, because\npublishing can affect the ability to obtain\na patent, it is best to submit a disclosure prior\nto publishing or communicating your findings\nin a public forum.         Q: When should I submit a disclosure?     It is best if inventors submit a disclosure\nbetween eight and 12 weeks before\npublication so that, if necessary, actions can\nbe taken to protect both U.S. and foreign\nrights. Once publicly disclosed, an invention\nmay not be patentable. To be safe, inform your\nOTM of any imminent or prior presentations\nthat include the IP.         Q: What is my role in the screening process?     Inventors typically meet with OTM staff\nto discuss the invention and clarify aspects\nof the disclosure. Once a decision is made on\nwhether to pursue patenting, the inventor will\nbe contacted to discuss the outcome.         Q: What is my role in patenting?     Inventors and OTM professionals speak\nwith the patent attorney during the patenting\nprocess. Also, inventors will need to\nreview drafts of documents, as well as sign\nassignments and other legal documentation.\nOTM will guide the inventors during the process.         Q: What is my role in marketing?     Inventors are encouraged to work closely with\ntheir technology manager to market their\ninvention. Inventors are often quite involved in\nthe early stages of recruiting commercial partners\nand licensees, as the inventor’s expertise is often\ncritically important. This involvement includes\nexchanging information and materials, and\nsometimes results in further sponsored research\n(dubbed pre-licensing agreements). Inventors\nare often involved in crafting the details of such\npre-licensing agreements.         Q: What is my role in licensing?     Licensing is the primary function of the OTMs,\nand inventors will be informed of progress.\nInventors often are closely connected to others in their field and may be consulted by their OTM on the business terms of the license. Further, the inventor’s role in licensing is an\nextension of their role in marketing since their\nexpertise is often critically important to transfer the technology and related know-how to the licensee. The University license places only nominal obligations on the part of the inventor to assist in the transfer of the licensed technology. When more than minimal time and effort is necessary, the licensee will negotiate a separate consulting arrangement with the inventor.         Q: What effect does a license have on my\nability to do research?     You can still continue research using a licensed\ninvention, even if it is exclusively licensed.\nThe University will always retain the right to\nuse licensed inventions in academic research\nand teaching.         Q: What if an industry partner funded my research and invention?     Your OTM will review the terms of the contract,\nsend a copy of the disclosure to the company,\ndetermine the company’s interest, and take\naction based on the company’s decision.         Start-Up        Q: What is a start-up company?     A start-up company is a new business entity\ncreated to market a specific invention. It is\nan alternative to licensing an invention to\nanother already existing company.         Q: What role does the inventor play in the\nstart-up company?     The inventor usually serves as a consultant or\nadviser to the new company. That role may\nchange as the company develops. However,\nmuch more time is required early in the\nprocess of establishing the company.         Q: What support does the University\nprovide to start-ups?     The University provides resources and\nservices that make start-up formation\neasier, such as IllinoisVENTURES and\nincubation facilities. University licenses to start-ups are\nstructured so as not to overburden the\ncompany financially during the first years.         Federal Agencies participating in STTR        Q: What is the minimum percentage of\nresearch that can be conducted by the\nsmall firm and institution receiving an\nSTTR award?     Small business must perform at least 40\npercent of the work, and research institutions\nmust perform at least 30 percent.         Q: When are the proposal deadlines?     Information on solicitations and\nproposal deadlines can be found at\nhttp://www.zyn.com/sbir/         Open Source        Q: What is the Open Source?     In the software community, Open Source is a\nforum in which multiple unaffiliated parties\nhave access to the source code of a software\nprogram for the purposes of collaborative\ndevelopment. People who participate in\nthe Open Source believe that more scrutiny\nbrings greater reliability and that software\nis an evolving entity that can achieve its\nfullest potential without the restrictions of\ncommercial sale.         Q: What’s my role in open source licensing?     As with decisions for publication, the faculty\nor head of the research program makes the\nrecommendation for open source dissemination.\nOften, the decision to release code into the\nopen source is made early in the software\ndevelopment process: as a condition of the\nfunding, as a requirement of participation in\nthe software community, or as a consequence\nof incorporating third party code that requires\nplacement in the open source. When software is placed in the Open Source,\nit is usually through the University of Illinois\nor NCSA Open Source License. This license\nplaces minimal restrictions on use, thereby\nmaximizing flexibility of use and dissemination.\nThe University of Illinois license can be\nviewed at http://www.opensource/licenses/\nUoI-NCSA.php.
