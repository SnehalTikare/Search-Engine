SIG Blockchain started in Fall 2017 with the intent to explore distributed ledger technology and its applications. Our group is mostly comprised of aspiring programmers and software engineers from the UIC student body.    What to expect  Members can expect to learn about blockchain on a technical and philosophical level. SIG Blockchain has its own cryptocurrency project called Allium that members can contribute to. There are usually opportunities to go to local events within the blockchain space throughout the semester as well.
