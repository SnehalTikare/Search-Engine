UIC School of Design 2019–20 public seminar series  Where does upending end up? When the ‘up’ becomes the ‘end’ so that the ‘end’ becomes the ‘up,’ will we eventually end up in the same place we were before? What is in between ‘the end’ and ‘the up’ and how might these points of reference shift?  Context and space matter: viewing a subject, object, or method from a different perspective can serve as a rich starting point for upending. There are countless ways to interact, sniff, touch, look, and listen. Makers, thinkers, maker/thinkers, and thinker/makers may come to similar topics of speculation through their own lenses — work that encourages not only contemplation and discussion but action.  What are the practical consequences and applications of speculation? Where does upending end up? This year’s UIC School of Design graduate public seminar series aims to critically examine flipping, twisting, tipping, inverting, reversing, overturning, and upending — inviting speculation on the potentiality of ending up.  – Grace Dyer and Hilary Short, 2019–20 UIC School of Design graduate public seminar series directors, MDES class of 2020 Special events 11.21.2019          Facebook  Twitter  Mail       Search form   Search               Contact  Opportunities         University of Illinois at Chicago   Privacy policy   College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts               ",
