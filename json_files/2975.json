It covers all core areas of sentiment analysis; includes many emerging\nthemes, such as debate analysis, intention mining, and fake-opinion detection; and\npresents computational methods to analyze and summarize opinions. It will be a\nvaluable resource for researchers and practitioners in natural language processing,\ncomputer science, management sciences, and the social sciences.
