As an interdisciplinary study, life science visualization has relevance to many disciplines including anthropology, art, biochemistry, bioengineering, biological sciences, chemistry, graphic design, integrated health studies, neuroscience, nursing, nutrition science and public health. Those who can leverage both their knowledge and artistic skill to visualize science will have an advantage when presenting their research or seeking employment.  Life science visualization is the important process of interpreting or translating science into visible form, and it is becoming a critical link in the bridge between information and knowledge in the 21st century.  Students who excel in visual problem-solving and value their curiosity in science can learn how to harness digital media technology to create dynamic works of art that advance understanding. Three-dimensional visualizations with interactive and motion media, virtual and augmented reality, educational games, as well as more traditional two-dimensional illustrations, are all being used today to communicate discovery and accelerate education in the life sciences.
