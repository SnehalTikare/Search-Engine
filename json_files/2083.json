Who is eligible for a Social Security Number?  How do I obtain a Social Security Number?  How should I handle my Social Security Number?  Do I need a Social Security Number to open a bank\n    account?  Can I apply for an Illinois driver's license\n    without a Social Security Number?    What is a Social Security Number?  Social Security Numbers (SSNs)\nare used to report a person’s wages to the U.S. government and to determine a\nperson’s eligibility for Social Security and other government services. For\nmore information, see the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) publication, Social Security Numbers for Noncitizens .    Who is eligible for a Social Security Number?  SSA issues SSNs to people\nlawfully admitted to the U.S. on a temporary basis who have authorization to work\nby the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In general, international\nstudents and scholars must have an authorized, paying job to be eligible for an\nSSN.   How do I obtain a Social Security Number?  In order to obtain an SSN you\nmust submit an application to a Social\nSecurity Administration (SSA) office . The contents of your\napplication will depend on your specific immigration status, as described\nbelow.  International students, scholars,\nand employees working at UIC should consult with your department administrator\nor Human Resources contact for additional guidance before starting this\nprocess.  When should I go to the SSA\noffice ?  OIS strongly recommends that you\nwait at minimum one business day from the date you arrive to the U.S. to apply\nfor your SSN. SSA must verify your immigration status in order to accept your\napplication and it takes one business day for federal databases to communicate\ninformation about your arrival and status to SSA. Applying early may result in significant delay of receiving your SSN.  Where is the SSA office?  While you may visit any SSA office location , the\noffices nearest UIC campuses are familiar with processing the applications of\nUIC students, scholars, and staff.   SSA\n    nearest UIC’s Chicago Campus   605 West Washington Boulevard   Chicago, IL\n60661  1-800-772-1213     SSA\n    nearest UIC’s Peoria Campus   815 West\nPioneer Parkway  Peoria, IL\n61615  1-877-319-6039     SSA\n    nearest UIC’s Rockford Campus   502 East\nJefferson Street  Rockford,\nIL 61107  1-877-628-6570    What should I bring to the\nSSA office ?   Passport  I-94\n    record  Address where your card can be successfully\n    delivered to you 2-6 weeks from your application date  Additional documentation   F-1 sponsored by UIC and working on-campus  – Form I-20 and Completed Social Security Support Letter for F-1 International        Students .  F-1 status on CPT – Form I-20 with current CPT\n        authorization and employer’s job offer letter.  F-1 status on OPT – Form I-20, USCIS issued EAD,\n        and employer’s job offer letter.  J-1 Exchange Visitor sponsored by UIC (student\n        or scholar) – Form DS-2019 and completed Social        Security Support Letter for J Exchange Visitor .  J-1 Exchange Visitor sponsored by a third party\n        – Form DS-2019 and additional support documentation as advised by program\n        sponsor (e.g. IIE Fulbright).  J-2 status – Form DS-2019, USCIS issued EAD, and\n        employer’s job offer letter.  H-1B, TN, or O-1 status – Form I-797.  Pending Permanent Residency – USCIS issued EAD.    What happens after I submit\nmy application ?  Once you apply, SSA will process\nyour application and, if approved, mail you a card containing your unique and\npermanent Social Security Number (SSN). It can take 2-6 weeks from the date of\napplication for the card to arrive by mail. After you receive your card, please\nsubmit a copy directly to your employer.  Most likely you will receive a\nSocial Security card that has the notation, “VALID FOR WORK ONLY WITH DHS AUTHORIZATION.”\nSSA issues this type of card to people lawfully admitted to the United States\non a temporary basis who have authorization to work by the Department of\nHomeland Security (DHS).   How should I handle my Social Security Number?  Your Social Security Number\n(SSN) is sensitive, personal identification information. In general, you should\nnot carry your Social Security card in your wallet on a daily basis. It may\nhelp to memorize your number and only carry the card when you know it will be\nneeded for a specific purpose. Common scenarios in which your SSN will be\nrequested are:  •  When an employer is\nsetting up payroll and tax paperwork at a new job.  •  When setting up a\nnew bank account, opening a credit card, or applying for a loan.  •  When a business\nneeds to check your credit in order to apply for an apartment, sign up for\nutilities, or get a contract-based mobile phone plan.  However, since SSNs are commonly\nused in identity theft scams, it’s a good idea to ask questions before deciding\nto share your number in-person, on a form, or online. For example if someone\nwants you to share your or your child’s SSN, you can ask:  •  Why do they need\nyour SSN?  •  How will your SSN be\nused?  •  How will protect\nyour SSN and other personal information?  •  What happens if you\ndon’t share your SSN?  •  Is there other\nidentifying information you can provide in place of the SSN?  If you don’t feel comfortable\nwith the answers to these questions, or you are being asked to share your SSN\nover public Wi-Fi to a non-encrypted website, it may be best to protect your\nSSN and not share it.  Information adapted from the\nFederal Trade Commission’s site, How to Keep\nyour Personal Information Secure .   Do I need a Social Security Number to open a bank account?  U.S. financial institutions are\nrequired to verify the identity of every individual who opens a bank account.\nIn compliance with federal regulations, all banks operating in the U.S. have\nestablished Customer Identification Programs (CIP) that they are to follow for\nanyone who seeks to open an account. While the specifics of the CIP may vary\nfrom one bank to another, Department of Treasury regulations found at 31 CFR §\n103.121 set forth the following minimal information that the banks must obtain\nfrom you before allowing you to open an account:   Your name  Your date of\n    birth  Your street\n    address – no P.O. Box  An\n    identification number   The regulations 31 CFR §\n103.121(b)(i)A)(4)(ii) clarify that for a non-U.S. person the identification\nnumber shall be one or more of the following:   taxpayer\n    identification number (ITIN)  passport\n    number and country of issuance  alien\n    identification card number  number and\n    country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing\n    nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard   It is important to remember that\nbanks establish their own customer identification programs and may ask for\nadditional documentation than is described above because they are ultimately\nresponsible for establishing the identity of their customers.   Can I apply for an Illinois Driver’s License without a\nSocial Security Number?  A Social Security Number is not\nrequired to obtain a State of Illinois Driver’s License. Internationals (F-1,\nF-2, J-1, J-2, among others) in Illinois may obtain a Temporary Visitor Driver’s\nLicense (TVDL) from various locations in the state. To apply, you will need to\nvisit the Social Security Administration to request a letter stating that you\nare not eligible for an SSN, this is known as a Form L-676. If, however, you\nare eligible for a SSN, then you must apply for and receive the SSN before\napplying for a state driver’s license.
