We are expanding our physical space to help meet enrollment growth, which has increased more than 100 percent since 2009. Investments in our research laboratories and classrooms are a top priority so that our students and faculty can learn, discover, experiment, and prototype in 21st century spaces.       New Computer Science Building      A new building for the computer science department—currently known as the Computing, Design, Research, and Learning Center (CDRLC)—is slated to open in 2022. This 148,000-square-foot building will feature modern, collaborative spaces designed for interdisciplinary activity. It will become a prominent fixture along what is becoming the engineering corridor on West Taylor Street, allowing us to accommodate our continued enrollment growth in computer science and to provide the most advanced learning, teaching, and research spaces for our students and faculty.       High-Bay Structures Laboratory      Opened in 2019 as part of the new Engineering Innovation Building , UIC’s High-Bay Structures Laboratory offers a site for large-scale infrastructure testing in the heart of Chicago.  Users can design and develop resilient, energy-efficient, and reliable infrastructure; identify ways to extend the life of existing infrastructure; and explore innovative new materials. The 6,000-square-foot space features a 45-foot ceiling, 30-foot-high L-shaped strong wall, and 6-foot-thick concrete floor.  In addition to supporting pioneering research by UIC students and faculty, it is available for contract by companies and agencies that seek to test large-scale structural components, such as sections of roadways and bridges.
