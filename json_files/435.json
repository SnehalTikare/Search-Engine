As we approach the 2020 Centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution and look towards the 2020 presidential election, we reflect on questions of women’s leadership, electoral power, voice, racism within women’s movements and women’s power to impact civic affairs.  This is an ongoing exhibition that is open to the public.  Museum Hours: Tuesday to Friday & Sunday 9:00am – 5:00pm Closed Mondays and Saturdays  Public Tours are offered Tuesday to Friday & Sunday at 10:00am & 3:00pm.
