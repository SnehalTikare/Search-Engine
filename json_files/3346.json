Participating  The MCL hosts research projects for teams of undergraduate students every semester. Applications are now open for Fall 2019 projects .  Follow MCL on Facebook or Twitter to receive announcements about future MCL projects, opening and closing dates for applications, and other lab events.  Facilities  The MCL is located in Room 709 of the Science and Engineering Offices building (SEO) which houses a computer lab, meeting space, 3D printer, and virtual reality hardware. The lab also manages several computation servers which provide project participants with the opportunity to run larger calculations.  Graduate students and faculty in the department may also affiliate with the MCL to use its facilities in their research, independent of the current undergraduate projects in the lab.  Acknowledgments  The MCL receives support from National Science Foundation, the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at UIC.  See \"About the MCL\" for details of past support, lab personnel, and other acknowledgements.
