At the graduate level, we have one PhD program for all of our research areas. This program specifically prepares students for research and teaching careers; the skills involved translate to many other possible careers though. We also offer an M.S. degree with concentrations in Pure or Applied Mathematics.  At the undergraduate level, the MSCS department offers a B.S. in Mathematics . This program prepares students for a very wide range of careers including almost any job or career in which strong analytical and communication skills are valued.
