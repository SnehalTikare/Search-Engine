Strong collaboration among faculty and ties to surrounding communities foster an exciting research climate in UIC Psychology!       Faculty        Bette L. Bottoms, Professor  Lab website: http://bbottoms.wixsite.com/psychlaw  The law makes many assumptions about the humans it seeks to control. Are those assumptions accurate? Are laws reasonable in light of what we know from psychological science? How can psychologists help inform the law and create a more just legal system? These are the questions my students and I address. Most of our current research focuses on factors that influence juror and jury decision making, often in cases of child sexual abuse or cases with juvenile offenders. For many years, we’ve been particularly interested in ways in which decisions are influenced by issues related to race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability. For example, all other things equal, jurors are biased against both victims and defendants who are from stereotyped groups (e.g., minority race, gay sexual orientation). We use psychological theory to understand the determinants of such decision making and how to address unfair bias in the legal system.          Pauline Maki, Professor  For over 20 years, Dr. Pauline M. Maki has led a program of NIH-funded research focused on the role of sex steroid hormones on cognition, mood, brain function (neuroimaging) and stress responsivity in women. Women’s cognitive abilities, mood, and response to stress can be affected by changes in sex hormones, like estrogen, including changes that occur during the menopausal transition, during pregnancy, and across the menstrual cycle. In particular, the goal of her work is to improve the lives of women by identifying factors that alter their risk of cognitive decline and affective disorders. Dr. Maki received her PhD in experimental psychology from the University of Minnesota in 1994. She received post-graduate training at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the dementias of aging and at the National Institute on Aging in neuroimaging. In 1999, she joined the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute on Aging. In 2002, she joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Chicago.          Amanda Roy, Assistant Professor  My research focuses on two lines of inquiry. The first of these examines neighborhood and environmental factors and their relationship to individual functioning. For example, I have explored how exposure to neighborhood characteristics such as poverty, racial/ethnic composition, crime, and organizational resources (e.g., health care services) influence the health and well-being of adults and children. I am currently using mobile technology to better understand where and when youth come in contact with environmental risk factors and how these exposures shape mood and risk-taking behavior. Finally, my work also explores ways that income and economic inequality influence youth development.          Linda Skitka, Professor  The Skitka Lab’s interests in moral conviction came to a considerable degree out of research interests in how people reason about distributive and procedural justice. Distributive justice refers to the principles people use to guide the allocation of the benefits and burdens of social cooperation.          Kate Zinsser, Assistant Professor The Social-Emotional Teaching & Learning Lab Contact: Dr. Kate Zinsser kzinsser@uic.edu  In Dr. Zinsser’s SETL lab, our research focuses on the quality of early childhood environments, especially the ways by which adults promote of young children’s social and emotional competence and well-being. Our work examines early childhood teacher-child interactions, classroom processes, instruction quality and emotion socialization practices that promote children’s social success, positive development, and achievement. We are especially interested in studying systems and policies that impact the equity of young children’s learning opportunities, including: gender and racial disparities in disciplinary practices, building collaborative teacher-parent relationships across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines, ensuring cultural representation and well-being in the teacher workforce, and developing measurement and evaluation tools that are valid across contexts and cultures.

She has research interests in developing culturally competent obesity (diet, physical activity, and body image) interventions and assessments for Latinos and Blacks using community-engaged approaches, disparities in weight loss after bariatric surgery across ethnic groups, and cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular risk reduction in Latinos.          Erin Berenz, Assistant Professor  Chicago Alcohol and Trauma Laboratory Lab website: https://chatlab.wixsite.com/uichicago  The goal of Dr. Berenz’s program of research is to identify malleable risk and maintenance factors for PTSD and AUD, particularly among survivors of interpersonal trauma (e.g., physical and sexual assault). Our lab is actively partnering with non-profit addiction treatment providers to enhance access to care among adults living in high-risk communities in the greater Chicago area. Dr. Berenz also serves as the UIC Clinical Psychology representative to the BRIDGE Program, a network of Clinical Psychology training programs dedicated to increasing diversity and inclusion in the field.          Megin Wardle, Assistant Professor  Although rates of drug use are equivalent across demographic groups in the U.S., socio-economically vulnerable and racial minority communities have disproportionately borne the health and social burdens associated with drug use and addiction. For example, although national attention and interventions have been mobilized to address opioid overdose, which contributes most to death rates for white Americans, the rate of cocaine overdose among African-Americans is equally high, and represents a long-overlooked public health problem. Consistent with this unaddressed need for treatment, my research program on novel treatments for cocaine use disorder sees a high proportion of African-American individuals, low-income individuals, and individuals from other historically disadvantaged communities seeking treatment for cocaine addiction.  This provides ample opportunities for students interested in serving under-served groups. It also provides potential for interested students to conduct investigations of the role of sociocultural factors, such as experiences of discrimination and socioeconomic inequality, in addiction and addiction treatment outcomes.
