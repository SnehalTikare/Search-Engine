UIC provides access to an exceptional education at the best possible cost.

Funding your education can be complex, but we’re committed to making college affordable by helping you through the financial aid process.  There are four basic types of financial aid:   Scholarships  Student employment  Assistantships and fellowships  Loans    Getting started  Most students submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to receive funding. Funds are limited in many programs, so it’s important to submit your FAFSA before UIC’s priority deadline of February 15 .     Office of Student Financial Aid    Undergraduate student aid    Graduate student funding overview    Apply for aid       Scholarships   The best kind of financial aid—the kind you don’t have to pay back!   College scholarships and awards  AHS offers these scholarship and awards to enrolled students:   AHS Scholarship Fund Award: Recognizing outstanding student leaders who maintain high academic achievement and demonstrate a commitment to volunteerism within the UIC community and greater Chicagoland area  Van Doren Scholarship: Awarded in fall and spring semesters to students in good standing and with financial need  The Scalzitti Scholarship: Funded through the generosity of alumnus David Scalzitti, who received three degrees from the UIC College of Applied Health Sciences    Department scholarships and awards  Individual programs in AHS have their own awards and scholarships to recognize and support their students.

Once you complete the UIC application, you’ll automatically be considered for most university and college scholarships and awards. Your application is reviewed to determine if any awards are a good fit.     UIC Office of Special Scholarship Programs    UIC SnAP    More about UIC scholarships       Student employment   On-campus jobs don’t offer tuition wavers, but they do provide a convenient location and work schedule. The UIC Student Employment Office can help connect you with departments that are hiring.  Learn more about the employment resources available for students and view the current job listings .     Student Employment Office       Assistantships   Most of our graduate programs employ graduate students as teaching (TAs), research (RAs) or graduate assistants (GAs). TAs help with classroom instruction, lab supervision, discussion sessions and grading. RAs work with faculty members in research activities. GAs generally perform clerical work in an academic department or administrative office.  An assistantship provides a stipend, tuition waiver, certain fee waivers and the option to buy low-cost health insurance. Most students find assistantships through their programs, so contact your Director of Graduate Studies for help.      Fellowships   The university and Graduate College both offer internal fellowships . These are awards aimed at recruiting outstanding students newly admitted to graduate programs at UIC.  Consider foundations and organizations outside UIC , for specialized and competitive fellowship opportunities like the Fulbright and DAAD grants.
