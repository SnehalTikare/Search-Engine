Users can use Echo360 to record their lectures in real-time for later viewing or to create videos outside of the classroom for students to review before and after class.  In addition to lecture capture in the classroom and universal capture for recording on a personal computer, the Echo360 Platform now includes a set of features to support class participation and student engagement. Using Echo360 polling tools, students can participate in class by asking and answering questions, even in large lecture halls. Instructors can then access the analytics for these interactions to form an opinion on the amount of engagement from individual students or the whole class.       Quick Access            Access via Blackboard            Access via Echo360               Request Classroom Capture            Access as Administrator             Contact Us          hide   AVAILABLE TO : Faculty | Students  FUNDED BY:  University       Answers  Features  More Info         Common Questions   Common Questions   How do I find out more about Echo360 Active Learning Platform (ALP)?  How do I access Echo360 Universal Capture?  My classroom does not support lecture capture. What can I do?  More….   Other Resources   Take a Poll with Echo360  21 Ways to Teach with Echo360            Features   Polling  There are five types of interactive activities to choose from: Multiple choice, Short answer, Image quiz, Ordered list, and Numerical. These polls can be used in class or can be used with online media for asynchronous activities. During a live presentation instructors can:   See the number of students who submitted answers  Close the question to further participation  Show submitted answers to students during the lecture  Show the correct answer to the question  Reset the activity to allow students to try again  Upload an image and create a correct answer based on a region of that image using the image quiz  Allow students to click and drag options into their chosen order to answer the question using the ordered list  Pose a question that has a numerical answer that is either a single number or falls in a pre-specified range using the numerical question  Utilize the justification setting that, when checked, requires students to write a short response to justify their answer            More Info   Requirements  The use of in-the-classroom polling with the Echo360 platform requires a section to be created in advance. Classroom Capture recordings must be scheduled ahead of time, and can be either one-time events or repeating semester events.  The ACCC-LTS assists with scheduling automatic capture of the east campus common use classrooms . For other classrooms, contact the appropriate department to have your lecture captured:   College of Pharmacy  College of Medicine  College of Dentistry   Universal Capture is available to all UIC faculty and instructors by request. Please note, users must already have courses created via Blackboard before submitting requests.  Recorded captures are kept on Echo 360’s servers for a period of four years before being removed.  If you are a college administrator, login to Echo360 System Administration to schedule college recordings.              Google Maps image     LTS Support Office   806 S.
