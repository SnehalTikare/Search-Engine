Psychology currently has 30 tenure-track faculty, 4 visiting assistant professors, 2 research professors and 6 lecturers. The Department of Psychology offers degrees oriented to understanding the complete human being across different levels of analysis that include the brain, the mind (cognitive and affective processes), the person (individual emotional and attitudinal patterns), the group and community (how members relate to each other and how individual group experience is impacted by cultural and community context). The central goal of the undergraduate and graduate training experience is to provide a contemporary, comprehensive and challenging exploration in understanding the complete human being.  Our faculty are internationally recognized for their cutting-edge research that has resulted in numerous national and international awards. The interdisciplinary approach to faculty research results in active collaborations with faculty in all other UIC colleges, particularly in the Colleges of Education, Engineering and Medicine. Psychology faculty are also actively involved in or direct Inter-College Programs such as the Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Council on Teacher Education, Institute for Health and Research Policy and Neuroscience Cluster Hire Initiative. Psychology faculty are further committed teachers and mentors leading to the largest number of teaching awards of any department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, including Department Teaching Award of Excellence, as well as several Teaching Recognition Program, Award for Excellence in Teaching and Silver Circle awardees. In addition, our graduate teaching assistants have received numerous teaching and mentorship awards.  Our department offers an undergraduate Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology with the option of a general or applied track. The general track provides a broad and comprehensive examination of human behavior that culminates in taking advanced laboratory courses in one of several Psychology subdisciplines (Behavioral Neuroscience, Clinical, Cognitive, Cognitive Neuroscience, Community, Developmental, Learning Conditioning, Mammalian Neuranatomy, Social Personality). The applied track offers courses in psychological testing, as well as, applied courses in interviewing and interventions. The focus is on direct skill building for fieldwork in addition to theoretical knowledge. This track culminates is a fieldwork practicum in one out of over 200 intern sites in the Chicagoland area. Psychology also contributes to a Bachelor of Science degree in Neuroscience. The curriculum is made up of principally from Psychology, Biological Sciences and Philosophy with the degree program administered by the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience ( lin.uic.edu ).  Our graduate program provides specialized training in one of five areas: Behavioral Neuroscience, Clinical, Cognitive, Community and Prevention Research, and Social and Personality.

Because faculty research is multidisciplinary, graduate training crosses traditional with exposure to multiple methods and levels of analysis. Psychology faculty also contribute to the interdisciplinary graduate programs in Learning Sciences ( www.lsri.uic.edu/learning-sciences-phd-program ) and Neuroscience ( www.uic.edu/depts/neurosci ).
