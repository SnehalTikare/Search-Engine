From Fulbright Grants to Goldwater Scholarships and many others, UIC students have received competitive fellowships that have helped them pursue academic and career interests here in Chicago and around the globe. OEF can help you pursue these opportunities too.  We help you explore the wide range of fellowship opportunities to determine which are best suited to your academic and career plans. Once you’ve found opportunities that are a good fit for you, and vice versa, we advise you closely through the whole process, so that your application is as strong as it can possibly be.  OEF can offer holistic guidance on communication about academic achievement, co-curricular involvement, life experiences, and financial need. We help students present themselves clearly and effectively for awards that best suit their needs. Students are welcome at any point in their degree program, and are encouraged to plan ahead. It’s never too early to start!
