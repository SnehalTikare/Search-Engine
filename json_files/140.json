To make your gifts via payroll deduction, complete the Payroll Deduction Authorization Form .        Annual Giving         content   Annual gifts to the UIC Engineering Excellence Fund are a powerful form of support because the donations are unrestricted and allow the College to enhance the educational experience of engineering students.

There are also ways to structure a gift to provide a lifetime income stream to yourself and/or a loved one while receiving an immediate income tax deduction. We’re happy to share customized illustrations for these types of arrangements at no cost or obligation.
