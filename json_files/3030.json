Each data is an EXCEL spreadsheet.    Explanations of various columns of the spreadsheet    Column 1:   District : This\r\ncolumn identifies the district number of the county in column 3.    Column 2:  County_id : Column 1 and column 2 together form an unique identifier for the counties in column 3.  A county is identified by its County_id (column 2) and the District (column 1) it belongs\r\nto. This was specifically needed to identify and differentiate the counties\r\nthat belonged to more than one district.    The software considers the counties belonging to different\r\ndistricts as separate entities.    Column 3:  County: This\r\ncolumn contains the name of the county.    Column 4:  Republicans : This\r\ncontains the total number of votes in favor of the Republican party (GOP) in the county identified by column 1 and column\r\n2.    Column 4:  Democrats : This\r\ncontains the total number of votes in favor of the Democratic party in the county identified by column 1 and column 2.    Column 5:  Neighbors: This\r\ncolumn contains information about the neighboring counties of the given county.\r\n� Neighboring counties � represents the\r\ncounties that share a boundary with the county identified by column 1 and\r\ncolumn 2. Neighbors are separated by commas.
