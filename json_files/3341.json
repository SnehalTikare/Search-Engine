Visit our college-wide student organizations page for more information about other College of Engineering student organizations that might be of interest, including interdisciplinary groups such as:   National Association of Black Engineers  Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers  Society of Women Engineers  Veterans in Engineering   Graduate students in bioengineering and bioinformatics also are eligible to join the UIC-wide Graduate Student Council .       Student Organization Guidelines           Alpha Eta Mu Beta  Alpha Eta Mu Beta is the national honor society for students of biomedical engineering. The society recognizes academic excellence and provides opportunities for networking, service, training, and leadership.   Visit website             Bioengineering Graduate Society  The Graduate Student Council serves to represent the bioengineering department outside of UIC, encourage personal and professional development among students, and act as a liaison group to the College of Engineering administration, among other key functions.   Visit website             Biomedical Engineering Society  The Biomedical Engineering Society sponsors applied research projects and organizes an annual research symposium. Research teams meet once or twice per week to pursue work that benefits people, such as 3D-printed prosthetics or filtering masks for people who live in cities with poor air quality.   Visit website             Engineering World Health  Engineering World Health members travel around the globe to perform service projects that improve health and well-being. With a focus on the developing world, UIC’s chapter of EWH recently has sent project teams to Rwanda and Vietnam.   Visit website             ​IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS)  ​IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) is the world’s largest international society of biomedical engineers. EMBS provides its members with access to the people, practices, information, ideas and opinions that are shaping one of the fastest growing fields in science.   Visit website             Society of Women Engineers  The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) is a national organization dedicated to serving and supporting students in engineering. Through various resources and opportunities, SWE empowers collegiate and professional members to be successful in their respective fields.   Visit website             UIC Bioengineering Student Journal  The UIC Bioengineering Student Journal, which comes out twice per year, offers an academic publication opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students alike. Writing for this journal undergoes a rigorous peer-review process that culminates in approval from the editorial board.   Visit website                       ",
