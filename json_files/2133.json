They have a number of residence halls on UIC’s three main campuses.   Campus Housing offers programs, activities and services that provide an   educational advantage for UIC students. They also offer premium   locations throughout the campus that other off-campus housing options   cannot.  If you are interested in campus housing, you should apply early since   spaces can fill up quickly. The application, as well as information   about deadlines and fees, can be found on the Campus Housing website .  If you arrange for Campus Housing, make sure to schedule your arrival   in accordance with a time the Campus Housing office will be open.  If you have questions about Campus Housing, you can contact the office at 312-355-6325 or housing@uic.edu .   Off-Campus   UIC has an Off-Campus Housing office located on the second floor of the Student Residence Commons, 700 S.   Halsted, Room 2026.  The office provides housing information and offers   many services that you may find helpful in making your living   arrangements. Many internationals choose to live off-campus. Chicago is   a big city with many diverse neighborhoods .  A word of advice : If finances are a concern, we recommend   that you do not rush into signing a housing contract (lease) until you   are aware of all your housing options. Calculate carefully what you can   realistically afford before making your decision. Be aware that   heating costs may not be included in your rent and may be a separate   expense. Due to the climate in Chicago, this can be expensive.  Apartment terminology When apartment searching you may run into some of the following terms:    Lease – A lease refers to the contract   that you sign when you rent an apartment.  A lease is a legal   relationship between the tenant (you) and the landlord.  Apartment – An apartment is a long-term accommodation, in   a housing unit which occupies part of a building.  Rental – A rental is when a payment is made by   temporary use of another’s property.  Hostel  - A hostel is a short-term,  budget  accommodation where customers can rent individual beds in social  rooms,  or sometimes private rooms but with a shared bathroom.  Apartment Search Company – An apartment company searches for an apartment for you free of charge.  Instead they are paid a percentage by the landlord.   Helpful websites Following are helpful websites, newspapers, and apartment search companies that may be of use to you in your search.
