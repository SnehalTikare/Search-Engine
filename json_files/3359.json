Students meet for a regularly scheduled two-hour workshop weekly to work collaboratively in small groups on math problems that emphasize the key ideas of the corresponding math course(see below). A trained teaching assistant and undergraduate AMP Scholar oversee the workshops. Students receive one hour of credit (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory).  ESP workshops are offered in conjunction with, and supplement required mathematics courses: Math 121. Pre-calculus Mathematics, Math 180. Calculus I, Math 181. Calculus II, Math 210. Calculus III, Math 215. Introduction to Advanced Mathematics*. Concurrent enrollment of mathematics courses is required.
