Individuals are recognized in several categories, including overall achievement or distinction in one's chosen profession; distinguished service toward enriching the lives of others and the welfare of humanity; significant professional leadership contributions as a young engineer; significant advocacy for and service to the College of Engineering; and significant lasting achievement as a Navy Pier alumnus/a.  The deadline for nominations is June 30, 2020. The Alumni Awards Selection Committee is composed of alumni and staff of the UIC College of Engineering and selects the recipient for each department. A maximum of six awards will be made for the Outstanding Achievement Award. All other award categories will have one winner. Should the committee determine that the nominee would be more appropriately honored by means of a different award, it reserves the right to consider each nominee for other, more suitable recognition. Awards will be presented at the Annual Alumni Awards Dinner in the fall.
