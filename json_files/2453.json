Hours of Operation  The hours of operation for our para-transit service extend beyond that which is mandated by law (must mirror fixed route service). As we offer 24/7 transportation services to our staff and students, the UIC para-transit service shall also operate overnight, on weekends, and on holidays for scheduled passengers and will accept “on demand” or emergency requests via our call center (weekend) or Night Ride dispatch service (overnight). It is important to note that “on demand” service requested during these circumstances will not be bound by the interval window used for scheduled service. Schedules submitted on Saturday for Sunday para-transit service will be directly accommodated, and not considered “on demand”. Office hours are Mon-Fri 4:00AM-11:00PM. Fixed route (Bus) hours are from 7:00AM-11:00PM.          Paratransit           Cancellations and No-Shows    Coverage Area and Hours                    ",
