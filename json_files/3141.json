Rather than extending the life span (the number of years a person lives), we are committed to prolonging the health span–emphasizing high quality of life, free of debilitating disease and dependence. Healthspan is a proactive healthy living model that moves away from the traditional healthcare model, where individuals primarily seek care in the hospital and clinics, oftentimes after becoming well-entrenched in poor health, toward an embedded culture of healthy living right where we live, learn and work.
