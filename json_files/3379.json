The Office of Mathematics Education (OME) aims to provide opportunities for prospective and practicing teachers to develop a strong foundation in mathematics and mathematics teaching. Our mission is to prepare elementary and secondary teachers that are proficient in mathematics and are committed to improving the education of all students. We offer degree programs, at the undergraduate and graduate levels, for prospective and practicing mathematics teachers. Our programs reflect a strong orientation towards inquiry-based pedagogies, and incorporate current research and effective practices in the mathematical preparation of teachers.  The OME also hosts an active research program in mathematics education. Faculty members direct a number of outreach programs for local schools, students, teachers and families. Faculty members are also investigators on federally-funded research projects and authors of nationally influential curricula for mathematics and science education.  We invite you to learn more about the degree and licensure programs we offer. If you would like to stay in touch and receive information about UIC and our teaching of mathematics programs, please fill out this form and select “Teaching of Mathematics” in the major field.  The degree of Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education is awarded by the College of Education to students in the Elementary Education Program. The OME supports the program by offering the courses MATH 140 and MATH 141 (which are required for admission) as well as the Concentrators Program . Mathematics Concentrators receive a BA in Elementary Education with mathematics as an area of concentration . Courses taken in the Concentrators Program can be used to fulfill some of the requirements for obtaining an Illinois Middle School Mathematics Endorsement on their teaching license.  Prospective secondary school teachers may choose the Mathematics Teaching major (MTHT) and earn the degree of Bachelor of Science in Teaching of Mathematics from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.  The Office of Mathematics Education administers graduate programs at the Masters and Doctorate levels. The Master of Science in Teaching of Mathematics is offered in both elementary and secondary education. At the secondary level, the department offers an MST program for teachers holding an Illinois License. Obtaining an Illinois secondary teaching license is an option within the program.  In coordination with the UIC Extended Campus , the OME offers courses designed to help teachers work towards a mathematics endorsement as well as professional development courses. Other continuing education courses are offered as part of the department’s participation in the CPS Algebra Initiative .
