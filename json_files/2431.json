COVID-19 Updates and Resources         Breadcrumbs   Honors College    Involvement    Service Opportunities        Service Opportunities  Honors College students have the opportunity to get involved with volunteering and civic engagement programs and events offered each semester. Many programs are in partnership with UIC Student Leadership and Civic Engagement . Students learn about the events and programs each semester through the Honors College Announcements, which are shared via email on a regular basis, and can also be found as archived posts . Programs offered typically include volunteer opportunities both on and off campus each semester, as well as civic engagement events that incorporate voter registration and guest lectures on political and Chicago community involvement.  For Honors College students looking to get involved with such programs and events on a regular basis, they are encouraged to sign up for a separate listserv. Students can send an email to hcservice@uic.edu to be added, or can add themselves by visiting listserv.uic.edu and searching for \"hcservice\".       Honors Ambassadors   Honors Ambassadors  Honors Ambassadors are Honors College students who take a leadership role by helping recruit and welcome new students into UIC and the Honors College. Honors Ambassadors assist new students joining the Honors College in their transition to the university and the Honors College community. Throughout the summer, Ambassadors reach out to new students and assist with summer orientation sessions to meet new students and answer their questions. During the Fall semester, Ambassadors are involved in a variety of activities to help new students adjust to UIC and the Honors College, including speaking to HON 101 Freshman Orientation Seminars about relevant topics, volunteering at Honors College admissions recruitment and interview events, organizing events to welcome new students and build community, and performing additional outreach to prospective and new students. For current Honors College students interested in becoming an Honors Ambassador, applications are available in the Spring semester.  Visit the Honors Ambassadors webpage to meet the current Honors Ambassadors!       Honors Tutors   Honors College Tutors  Honors College Tutors serve as volunteers in the Honors College Tutoring Room during the Fall and Spring semesters, providing tutoring services to the full UIC community. Tutors are selected through an application process prior to the start of each semester, and can tutor subjects based on UIC courses in which they earned an “A” or “B.” Honors College Tutors are required to complete 4 hours of tutoring per week, Monday-Friday between 9am and 4pm, starting the third week of the semester and ending during the last week of classes (before finals week begins). Schedules are coordinated during the application process, and Tutors complete an onboarding/training before they begin their tutoring shifts. Honors College Tutors may choose to use their tutoring role as a Service Activity for the semester.  Visit the Honors College Tutoring page to learn more about the hours and typical schedule of topics. Application details for interested tutors will be sent out via the Honors College Announcements each semester.
