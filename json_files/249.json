The need which will drive new OS adoption is security. Ethos indicates what is possible with such a design philosophy.         More About Ethos         Software Release Plans   Ethos will be released as open source. We are targetting MinimaLT, a secure network protocol, as our first release. MinimaLT is developed within Ethos, and will be ported to POSIX. We intend to release a research prototype in the Spring Semester, followed by a production code .        links        News          Help Us            tiles           Committee on National Security Systems             National Science Foundation            Security Links        cr.yp.to          Risks Digest          Cryptogram          NIATEC          IEEE Security and Privacy          ACM SIGSAC            tiles                                                               ",
