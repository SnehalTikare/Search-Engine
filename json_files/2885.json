The annual banquet also marked the organization’s 50th Anniversary of Illinois Section.  Nabin Kafle took home the “Graduate Scholarship Award 2016,” Nima Golshani received the “Best Student Paper Award 2016,” and Yousef Dana nabbed the “Undergraduate Scholarship Award 2016.” The UIC students beat out students from universities throughout Illinois.  “It was a great honor to receive the 2016 Graduate Scholarship Award,” said Nabin Kafle, president of the UIC ITE Chapter. “More than winning the award for myself I am delighted to know that all three awards were bagged by UIC students. As a President of the newly revived ITE-UIC Chapter, I think this was a big start for the Chapter. I hope this will spur more graduate and undergraduate students toward Transportation Engineering.”  “This is a demonstration of how excellent our students are, and their excellent work in research and their enthusiasm and passion for the transportation engineering field,” said CME Professor Bo Zou, who is the faculty advisor for the ITE UIC chapter. “There are many recent innovations and it is very exciting time in the transportation field with all of these technology advances.”  “UIC provides a world-class program in Transportation Engineering,” said Kafle. “With the excellent faculty advisors and research infrastructures, Transportation Engineers from UIC have continuously marked their presence in the various fields from research to job industries. I believe UIC is preparing its student for the working world in every field.”  The ILITE scholarship opens every year during October and November.
