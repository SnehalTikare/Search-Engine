In an effort to help graduate students from inadvertently including previously published work in their theses or dissertations without proper citation, paraphrasing, or quoting, the Graduate College requires students to screen their theses and dissertations using iThenticate * , prior to their defense.  Access to iThenticate will be given to the student by the Graduate College upon submission of the Committee Recommendation Form for the final defense (submission of form is required a minimum of three weeks before the proposed date of defense).  The student is the sole author of their thesis or dissertation, and it is the student’s responsibility to ensure that all information in their document is correctly cited and attributed, and that proper copyright permissions have been obtained. The iThenticate screening process should be only one part of their effort towards this end.  For example, iThenticate cannot detect images and figures taken from other sources, texts in languages other than English, and user error (e.g. inappropriate exclusions).  Screening a thesis or dissertation using iThenticate will not add your thesis/dissertation, or text, to the iThenticate database.  Below is the text of email announcement sent to all graduate students, graduate faculty, and graduate program staff via Graduate College listservs on December 3, 2014.    Text of Email Announcement         Inital Process   Initial Process  At least three weeks before the proposed date of defense of the completed thesis or dissertation, a Committee Recommendation Report Form must be submitted to the Graduate College.  Although the Graduate College may not process the form immediately (i.e. review the information for acuracy, approve the committee, and send the resultant blank Examination Report Form and related material to your program), within a few days of receipt of the form you will receive notification of access to iThenticate.  Once access has been granted, the student will be sent an automated email from “noreply(@)ithenticate.com,” with a subject line “Account Created for Select Faculty and Students.”  Students should check spam and/or junk folders if receipt is in doubt.  Access to iThenticate is retained until the final, fully corrected and defended version of the thesis/dissertation is uploaded into the Electronic Thesis and Dissertation system.  Students are required to review their thesis/dissertation, make appropriate adjustments, and submit the appropriate information (as described on these pages).    Electronic Thesis and Dissertation System         Introduction to Screening Your Thesis or Dissertation   Introduction to Screening Your Thesis or Dissertation  The Introduction to Screening Your Thesis or Dissertation is intended to provide the student with the rationale for the iThenticate review, and to provide guidance on some common issues with citation and attribution.    Introduction to Screening Your Thesis or Dissertation (PDF)         iThenticate and Box Operation Manuals   iThenticate and Box Operation Manuals  The iThenticate Operation Manual and the Box Operation Manual will guide you through the process of establishing your iThenticate account (once the Graduate College has provided your access – see Initial Process section above), preparing your thesis/dissertation for review, uploading your thesis/dissertation into iThenticate, information on how to run and save the reports, properly review the results, and make corrections (if necessary), In addition, there is information on setting up a Box account and providing access within Box.    iThenticate Operation Manual    Box Operation Manual         Video Demonstrations for iThenticate and Box Operations      Preparing your Document to be Uploaded.

This form must be submitted to the Graduate College before your submission may be approved.    iThenticate Report Form         More Information   More Information    iThenticate Trademark and Usage Policy    iThenticate Privacy Pledge    iThenticate Information on Citations and Attributes    Purdue University Online Writing Lab (OWL) Overview of Plagiarism    Indiana University Bloomington Plagiarism Writing Guide            Academics           Dates & Events    Registration Info    Thesis     Electronic Thesis Dissertation     ETD FAQ    ETD Format    ETD Submission Process      iThenticate Review Procedures    Survey of Earned Doctorates      Exams & Defense     Exams & Defense Forms    Committee Membership Policy      Policies & Procedures    TA Enrichment    Graduation Info    Student Forms    Student Resources                      ",
