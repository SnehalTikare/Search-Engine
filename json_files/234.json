Berkeley Thursday April 18, 2013 11:00 a.m., 1000 SEO Building        Abstract:   I will present the BitBlaze project, describing how we build a unified binary program analysis platform and use it to provide novel solutions to computer security problems, including automatic vulnerability discovery and defense, in?depth malware analysis, and automatic extraction of security models for analysis and verification. The BitBlaze Binary Analysis Infrastructure is a fusion of static and dynamic analysis techniques and enables a set of powerful, novel symbolic reasoning techniques on program binaries. I will give an overview of the WebBlaze project, aiming at designing and developing new techniques and tools to improve web security, including automatic dynamic symbolic execution on JavaScript for in?depth vulnerability detection in rich web applications. Finally, I will describe some ongoing efforts in DroidBlaze , an automatic security analysis infrastructure for Android apps.  More information about BitBlaze and WebBlaze is available at http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu and http://webblaze.cs.berkeley.edu       Bio:   Dawn Song is Associate Professor of Computer Science at UC Berkeley. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, she was an Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University from 2002 to 2007. Her research interest lies in security and privacy issues in computer systems and networks, including areas ranging from software security, networking security, database security, distributed systems security, to applied cryptography. She is the recipient of various awards including the MacArthur Fellowship, the Guggenheim Fellowship, the NSF CAREER Award, the Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship, the MIT Technology Review TR?35 Award, the IBM Faculty Award, the George Tallman Ladd Research Award, the Okawa Foundation Research Award, the Li Ka Shing Foundation Women in Science Distinguished Lecture Series Award, and Best Paper Awards from top conferences.
