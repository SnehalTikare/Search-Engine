Consequently, the University of Illinois at Chicago seeks to maintain a campus environment that is free of the illegal use of alcohol and other drugs. To meet this goal, we promote and practice the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988 and the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Amendments of 1989 by annually producing and distributing this Alcohol and Other Drugs Policy. It summarizes some of the state and federal laws used to regulate alcohol and other drugs and the potential health risks associated with their use. The Universityâ€™s standards of conduct, related policies, and established disciplinary actions for student conduct violations are outlined in this document as well as UIC campus and community resources for substance abuse issues.         2019-2020 UIC Alcohol and Other Drug Policy          Policies           Alcohol and Other Drug    Smoke Free Campus Policy and Fine Payment     Smoke/Tobacco-Free at UIC      Student Disciplinary Policy    Cannabis Policy                    ",
