See the placement page for information about ALEKS. Transfer students can also be placed into MSCS courses on the basis of transfer credit. It is crucial for success at UIC that students be placed into courses for which they have appropriate preparation.  Chicago City College agreement  Please see our page for the Chicago City College agreement for a table of equivalences between UIC courses and Chicago City College courses and special rules about math placement the apply only to transfer students from the City Colleges.  AP Exams  UIC awards college credit for certain MATH and MCS courses to students who have sufficiently high scores on Advanced Placement exams. Of course, these students are not required to take the Math Placement Exam and may register directly into the appropriate class. Students should contact the College Board if AP scores have not been recorded correctly.  Please consult our table of what AP scores are required to receive credit for courses through the AP program and keep in mind that you may still be required to take the ALEKS placement exam to register for Math courses at UIC.  Math Labs  Tutoring for Math 070 through Math 210 is available on Tuesdays and Thursdays throughout the semester. Times and locations are announced in class.  Proficiency Exams  Proficiency exams are given at the end of each semester. Students must first get approval from their college and their major advisor. Rules governing the exam can be found in the undergraduate catalog . Students may petition to take proficiency exams at our main office (322 SEO) near the end of the term.  Emerging Scholars Program  The Emerging Scholars Program offers workshops where students can work on challenging mathematics problems with classmates using innovative techniques of cooperative learning.
