The seven Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change are a collaborative group that aims to make UIC a welcoming and inclusive place for all students, faculty and staff. The Centers are committed to student success, intercultural engagement, vibrant scholarship, and dynamic community partnerships.   Learn more          Mission    The diversity of our campus community is apparent—UIC is a higher education institution where diversity is a cornerstone of intellectual achievement. We engage people from all communities of Chicago and many other communities in the state which we serve.    A Mosaic for UIC Transformation | Mission Statement           Diversity Education  Representational diversity is a resource that must be intelligently and intentionally drawn on to be appreciated and ultimately produce positive outcomes. Representational diversity is the first step in a spectrum of intentional efforts designed to maximize the benefits of diversity by incorporating it in our living, teaching, learning, research, and public service. We expect students to learn more about diversity, and faculty and staff have opportunities, methods, and resources for developing diversity competencies. New vehicles for communicating about diversity are offered as are resources for encouraging collaboration among researchers and practitioners of diversity.     Inclusive Classroom    Words Matter!    Dialogue Initiative                Data and Research  Many are attracted to UIC by its diversity, but simple exposure to difference cannot transform our campus into a thriving community that values difference. We must begin by knowing our campus climate as it truly is. UIC assesses the climate experienced by its staff, students, and faculty by means of a periodically reiterated survey, identifies shortcomings, and designs solutions. \r\n\r\nIn addition to campus wide surveys, taskforces, charged by the leadership, collect information on specific identified issues and publish their findings advising action.     Taskforce Findings and Publications    Data Points                Resource Portal  Our commitment to diversity extends beyond policies and statements and is guided by the following core values: Knowledge, Openness, Access, Excellence, Collaboration, and Caring. These values, foundational to our institutional culture, work together to ensure a campus climate where all our community members feel welcomed and valued.
