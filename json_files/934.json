The global women’s health component can consist of clinical research, education and/or clinical services. In this fellowship, we will provide mentorship, opportunities and resources for the fellow to develop educational initiatives, improve clinical services, and lead clinical research in global women’s reproductive and gynecologic health.  We will provide international field experience and mentorship.  Fellows will be encouraged to utilize collaborations within the UIC community, such as Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, School of Nursing, Department of Anthropology, and have opportunity to develop relationships with international governmental and non-governmental organizations in order to perform effective global women’s health work. The program will be a platform to build strong relationships in Mekelle, with possibly other areas of Ethiopia.  Given the growing need for physician leadership in the international women’s health community, this program will provide experience, leadership, and opportunities in global women’s health research in Ethiopia. Goals The goal of UIC’s Global Women’s Health Fellowship is to mentor obstetrician-gynecologists in global women’s health so that they can meaningfully contribute to sustainable development of women’s health through humanitarian, clinical, educational and research efforts.  The program provides initiatives in women’s reproductive and gynecologic health, and opportunities to develop leadership skills. Objectives The objectives of the UIC Global Women’s Health Fellowship are: Build a solid foundation of knowledge about global women’s health issues, a fundamental understanding of health care systems, social, cultural contexts and political environments. Acquire ability to understand and identify women’s reproductive and gynecologic health needs, and design, implement and evaluate interventions. Develop leadership skills to lead global women’s health projects once the fellowship is completed. Understand and apply the concepts of sustainability and capacity building in global women’s health. Develop an education project and/or clinical research project which addresses a women’s reproductive or gynecologic health issue for a specific population. Establish network and skills for educational exchange, research, and funding. Fellowship Expectations Fellows will receive intensive mentorship from UIC core faculty as well as Ethiopian faculty who are recognized for their expertise in women’s reproductive and/or gynecologic health. Fellow responsibilities include: Clinical Provide excellent clinical care in Obstetrics and Gynecology as a junior faculty member at the University of Illinois at Chicago (50% time), with associated in-house obstetrical call as assigned. Teach residents and medical students at the University of Illinois at Chicago and at hospitals associated with Mekelle University. Research Participate in ongoing research projects Develop at least one new research project Publish at least one manuscript in global women’s health in a peer-reviewed journal. Provide mentorship to OBGYN residents interested in global women’s health. Training Complete at least one course in community health practice, public health management, and/or clinical research methodology or statistics, to be determined based on the fellow’s experience, career plans and availability of courses. Field Experience The fellow will be expected to complete a research project with the two-years. The UIC Department of OB/GYN has an active collaborative partnership with Mekelle University, College of Health Sciences. Our goal is to strengthen the existing OB/GYN residency program at Ayder Referral Hospital, to provide support for medical student education and faculty development and conduct ethical research through Mekelle University.  Clinical experience is based at Ayder Referral Hospital and Mekelle Hospital in Mekelle. Dr. Goba, UIC Global Women’s Health Fellowship Director, has several ongoing research, education and service delivery projects through Mekelle University. There may be other field opportunities available through the UIC Center for Global Health. Requirements Candidates must complete an OB/GYN residency and be Board-eligible or certified in OBGYN prior to starting the fellowship. In addition, the candidate must have an Illinois State Medical License prior to starting the fellowship. Salary, and Benefits Salary and benefits will be at the PGY 5 and PGY6 level. A stipend will be provided for in-house OBGYN coverage. Funding for field experience and project costs will be provided. Overseas benefits, such as evacuation insurance, will be provided.
