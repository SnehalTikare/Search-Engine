Consent           Frequently Asked Questions   Q: Do we have to use a condom if my partner is on birth control?  A: Condoms are not just for preventing pregnancy.  Condoms, when used properly prevent the transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STI’s).  To prevent STI’s it is important to always use a condom before engaging in sexual activity.  Q: What is the point of oral sex condoms and dental dams and when should they be used?  A: Oral sex condoms and dental dams are to be used when engaging in oral sex.  Many STI’s such as, Chlamydia, Herpes, Human Papillomavirus, HIV, and Trichomoniasis are transmissible through oral sex.  Q: What are the symptoms of a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)?  A: A UTI is an infection in any part of the urinary system, the kidneys, bladder or urethra.  Symptoms may vary from person to person but many people feel a burning sensation when urinating, frequent or intense urge to urinate, pain or pressure in back or lower abdomen, cloudy, dark, or smelly urine, feeling tired or shaky, and/or fever or chills.  It is important that you seek a health care provider as soon as you suspect that you may have a UTI.  UTI’s are commonly treated with antibiotics.  Q: Can I use the same condom twice if I don’t ejaculate?  A: No, once you have put on a condom it is important that it stays on.  Once you take it off, it should be discarded.  Condoms are only meant to be used one time and if not used properly the effectiveness is compromised.  Q: Can I get pregnant if I had unprotected sex during my menstrual cycle?  A: There is always a chance of pregnancy when you have sex, especially unprotected.  Abstinence is the only way to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancy.  Q: Do I still need to use a condom when having anal sex?  A: Absolutely! You should always use protection when having anal sex.  STI’s such as Chlamydia, Herpes, Genital Warts, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis B, HIV, and Syphillis.  There are higher risks of bacteria infections such as Hepatitis A and E. Coli (fecal matter) when engaging in anal sex.  Due to the sensitive membrane around the anus, contact with blood is likely.  Q: When should I take emergency contraceptives after having unprotected sex?  A: Emergency contraceptives are most effective when taken within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex.
