According to the most recent data from the Society of Women Engineers, a national professional and advocacy organization, there was a 54-percent increase nationwide in the number of bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science earned by women.  Still, there is work to be done. The SWE data show that only 13 percent of engineers and only 26 percent of computer scientists are female, a phenomenon that also plays out at the college level, where only about a fifth of the students earning bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science are women.  UIC Engineering has developed a strong Women in Engineering Program to help create greater balance in academia and the engineering workforce. This page provides a broad summary of our programming; visit the Women in Engineering Programs website for full details.           Opening doors for women in engineering  A greater role for women in engineering tomorrow means encouraging more girls to study engineering and computer science today. UIC’s encourages female applicants to participate in a SWE-sponsored campus Shadow Day to meet current students and faculty. We also run programs for K-12 students, including Girls Who Code and the Women in Engineering Summer Program.   Learn more about programs for prospective female students        Student Organizations           Society of Women Engineers             Women in Computer Science           Women in Engineering Programs   Programming for women in engineering at UIC is continually growing and changing to meet the needs of our current—and future—female students. Services currently include:   Scholarship support , including merit scholarships that are awarded to high-achieving first-year female students in engineering and computer science. Our women in engineering office also advises students on places where they can seek additional external scholarships.  Leadership opportunities through the Society of Women Engineers and other activities. UIC Engineering students inspire the next generation of girls to pursue computer science and engineering by leading events such as Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day , participating in the Girls Who Code program , and working with high school juniors and seniors in the Women in Engineering Summer Program , sponsored by Knowles Corporation, a champion for the advancement of women and girls in engineering and STEM fields.  Community development through student organizations as well as outside-of-class personal and professional development programs and events that help current female UIC students to meet successful UIC alumni.
