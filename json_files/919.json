The Center connects campus and community partners who reflect Chicagoland’s diverse intellectual and cultural life to promote intercultural understanding and social change.   The AACC is one of seven (7) Centers for Cultural Understanding and Social Change (CCUSC) located in the Office of Diversity under the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs and Provost.    Beginning Monday, March 16 the offices of the African American Cultural Center will be closed until further notice. In addition, we are suspending all public programs, tours, and space requests.  Even though the offices of the African American Cultural Center will be closed, we are still here for you.  Join us as we Create Our Virtual Community, a series of virtual programs designed to keep us connected and focused on the positive.  See below for more information.
