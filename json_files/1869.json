A few reminders: It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to request approval from their instructor to take an exam or quiz at the Disability Resource Center (DRC). Approval of the testing date and time must be granted before the student submits a scheduling request.  To schedule an exam or quiz, students need to submit a scheduling request through the Accommodate portal, linked on the DRC website, drc.uic.edu. Testing is conducted Monday-Friday from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm, with start times at the top of each hour. Exams and quizzes must be scheduled at least 3 days prior to the requested testing date and final exams must be scheduled at least 5 days prior to the requested testing date. Exam rooms are only visible when requesting within the above guidelines, otherwise the system will show that there are not any rooms available. In these instances, please contact the DRC to check availability. Due to high testing volumes, the DRC cannot guarantee that spots will be available to accommodate last minute requests.
