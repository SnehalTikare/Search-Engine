Our department is located just outside the vibrant downtown of Chicago and near major hubs for ground, rail, and air transportation. The Chicago region is home to a large number of industries that interact with our faculty and employ our graduates.  We offer BS, MS, and PhD degrees in each of the disciplines of mechanical and industrial engineering. We also offer a BS degree in engineering management and a unique master’s degree in energy engineering designed for working professionals. These programs are supported by 37 full-time professors , several additional teaching and research faculty, and substantial annual research funding for graduate students working as researchers in one of our research labs and centers .  Mechanical engineering is one of the oldest fields of engineering, yet it is constantly evolving through its applications in emerging areas. Today, mechanical engineers are not only trained in traditional fields such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, machine design, and controls, but they also learn how to apply the fundamental principles of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to exciting modern fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. Mechanical engineering is also one of the broadest fields of engineering. Our graduates find jobs in industries such as energy, aerospace, manufacturing, robotics, and medical devices.  Industrial engineering is concerned with the analysis, design, improvement, and installation of integrated systems of people, material, information, equipment, and energy. It is where engineering meets business. Industrial engineers are trained to eliminate practices that waste time, money, energy, and other resources. Graduates can work in almost any industry, including manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, transportation, finance, electronics, and entertainment.  Our MIE community provides a congenial atmosphere for undergraduate and graduate studies and for collaborative work with industry and academic partners. We are committed to excellence in research, teaching, and service.  I encourage you to learn as much as you can about our programs. Look over our faculty research profiles on our website. Visit the department in person to talk to faculty and meet students. I’m confident you will find that MIE offers the breadth and vision in its undergraduate, graduate, and collaborative programs that you seek. I invite you to consider becoming a part of this talented and dynamic community.  — Farzad Mashayek , PhD  Professor and Department Head          About           Mechanical Engineering    Industrial Engineering    Energy Engineering    Advisory Board    Contact    Head's Message                    ",
