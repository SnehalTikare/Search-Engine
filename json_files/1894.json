According to the most recent report card issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, more than a third of the 600,000 bridges in the United States are more than 50 years old. About 32 percent of urban roads and 14 percent of rural roads are in poor condition. Our network of water pipes is aging.  UIC will contribute to improvements by uniting renowned researchers, energetic students, and forward-thinking companies and agencies in our laboratory, which:   Offers unique faculty-developed damage-detection sensors that can generate big data on structural degradation and real-time 3D immersive visualization;  Allows us to monitor key elements of structural health, such as fiber-optic strain and acoustic emission;  Sets the stage for UIC to be first in developing revolutionary new materials, such as metamaterials that allow new structural designs for buildings and bridges;  Is the Chicago area's only high-bay structural testing laboratory.        About the Lab      General specs   6,000 square feet  45-foot high ceiling  30-foot high L-shaped strong wall  6-foot thick strong floor   Primary objectives   Design and test resilient, energy efficient, reliable infrastructure  Extend the life of existing infrastructure  Explore innovative new materials        Equipment and Systems   The civil and materials engineering department is now building out the High-Bay Structures Laboratory with the equipment, systems, and features needed to meet the requirements of the industry and agency partners, faculty, and students who will conduct tests in the facility. Expand the section below to see the full list.      Planned Equipment and Systems         1   Major Equipment   Main hydraulic pump with all the needed hydraulic pipes to all ports (as noted on the drawings)  Closed loop servo-hydraulic actuators up to 150 kips and strokes up to 15 inches (4 actuators)  Closed loop servo-hydraulic hydraulic actuators up to 300 kips and strokes up to 20 inches (4 actuators)  Other actuators: two each with capacities of 100 kips, 50 kips, and 20 kips.  Computerized control systems to control the actuators (4 controllers)  Data acquisition systems to record experimental data from extensive measurement devices  Universal compression/tension testing machine up to 1000 kips   Structural Systems for Testing:   Structural steel frames for testing columns  Structural steel frames for testing small to medium to full scale testing  High strength steel threaded anchors to connect the base plates to the structural floor  Steel threaded bolts at the ends to connect the hydraulic actuators to the structural wall  Individual structural cross steel frames for load application  Structural steel spread beams  Other necessary fixtures  Hydraulic cylinders with load capacity that range from 25 kips to 500 kips  Hydraulic cylinders with strokes that range from 6 to 20 inches  Steel and/ or concrete supporting systems for beams or slab systems  Hydraulic pumps (10,000 psi) for load applications  Hydraulic hoses (10,000 psi)  Adaptors to connect the hydraulic hoses to the hydraulic cylinders (10,000 psi)  Digital Gauges for the hydraulic systems (10,000 psi)  Tools to support the lab  Forklift for moving things around the lab  Data Acquisition System for collecting Data up to 50 data points for load, deflection, strain, temperature, and frequency  Computer to control the DATA Acquisition System  Load Cells for load measurements  LVDTs for deflection measurements  Frequency instruments  Panel concrete mixer up to 15 cubic feet              The High-Bay Lab and UIC   Benefits to UIC Students  The laboratory opens the door to new elements of the civil and materials engineering curriculum, including:   New courses, including Experiment-Based Structural Design, Structural Inspection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, and Forensic Engineering  A new project-based learning class at the graduate level called Civil Engineering Claims and Disputes, in which students will learn about design deficiencies, structural and material flaws, QC/QA practices, and claims and disputes  New experimental data to enhance case studies taught in courses such as Nondestructive Evaluation of Concrete Structures, Fracture Mechanics and Failure Analysis, Introduction to Data Science, and Cities and Sustainable Infrastructure  Space to test student work, such as the ASCE steel bridge and concrete canoe  Video recording of experiments so that students can visualize structural behavior and failure, illustrating the theory they learn in the classroom   Advances in Research and Discovery  The lab will allow our faculty to compete for national grants involving large-scale structural testing. Research examples include:   Testing new types of metabraces to absorb seismic loads  Conducting impact and penetration tests for structural components and earthen materials  Testing decommissioned elements of Chicago’s antiquated infrastructure  Exploring new applications of Basalt Fiber Reinforced Polymer  Optimizing bridge connections using additively manufactured lattices        Faculty Research   UIC faculty have begun developing and expanding their research agendas based on the introduction of the High-Bay Structures Laboratory.
