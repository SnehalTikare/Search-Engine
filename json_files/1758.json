A non-disclosure agreement will be required for in-depth discussions of confidential information related to our technologies.         Q: Does UIC OTM have a template NDA available?

Yes.\nWe allow our potential licensees to enter into ‘Option Agreements’ which allow the licensee to utilize our IP for a short period of time in order to ascertain whether the technology is a good fit for their business.  After expiration of the Option agreement, our team will work with licensees to negotiate a license agreement that is beneficial for all parties involved.         Q: What types of technologies are available for license?     We have a variety of high-quality technologies available including medical devices, course curriculums and content, software, therapeutics, diagnostics, research tools and much more.
