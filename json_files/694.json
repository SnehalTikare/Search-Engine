Learn More About  Why Students Choose Jane Addams         space            Jane Addams Spotlights        Faculty  Associate Professor Christopher Mitchell has been awarded a UIC Award for Excellence in Teaching . Professor Mitchell says that being an educator is rewarding on many levels, but he enjoys interacting with students the most. “Social work students continually impress me with their idealism and commitment to helping others, particularly people most in need,” he says. “I am proud to be part of the Jane Addams College of Social Work and the University.”          Student  MSW student Treshana Lewis has been honored with a prestigious Minority Fellowship from the Council on Social Work Education. The fellowship is awarded to students who demonstrate a commitment to working with underrepresented and underserved racial/ethnic minority persons with or at risk for mental health and/or substance abuse disorders. “Participating in the fellowship’s specialized mental/behavioral health trainings while obtaining an MSW from Jane Addams will prepare me to be a competent clinician,” she says, “so that I can address the behavioral health concerns of individuals that resemble myself or reside in communities that mirror my own.”          Alumnus  Elizabet Bonilla Escobar, MSW ’18, is a Child Protection Specialist with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. She says, “Working in child welfare is taxing and exhausting, but incredibly rewarding. It requires a lot of discipline, heart and strength. I can honestly say that attending Jane Addams was key in helping me get there.” While she was an MSW student, Elizabet participated in the college’s Child Welfare Traineeship Program . “The Traineeship gave me a valuable head start and I am eternally grateful for the opportunity, and I recommend that anyone who’s considering a career in child welfare, apply for the Traineeship.”            space                Ready to Take the Next Step?
