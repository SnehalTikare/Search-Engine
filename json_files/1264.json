You were able to assist us in spreading the word about an entry level opportunity we had for a Mechanical Engineer to your graduates and we immediately had highly qualified candidates contact us who had the right credentials our client needed. We were able to successfully place one graduate within only a couple of weeks and hope to place the other candidates soon.
