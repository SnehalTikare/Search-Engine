Broadly speaking, I am interested in most aspects of data center networking. I am especially interested in the intersection of network systems, operating systems, and computer architecture.  In addition to my interests in computer science, I enjoy participating in many hobbies, including music, kaizo Mario, biking, boarding, and brewing. I enjoy many types of biking, from commuting on a road bike to riding dirt jumps on a BMX.  Research Interests:  I am looking for motivated and passionate students. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to reach out and start a conversation with me. My interests in computer science are broad, and I am willing to entertain any compelling projects. However, I am currently particularly interested in the following research areas:   Designing new switch programs that fundamentally rethink flow control, e.g., how switch should drop packets, and how switches should avoid dropping packets.  New architectures for reconfigurable match table (RMT) switches and NICs.  Explicitly co-scheduling network and CPU resources so as to maximize high-level application and infrastructure objectives.  Integrating programmable NICs and switches into the OS and network core by developing new protocols and offloads that treat the servers and network in a cluster as a single heterogeneous processor.  New abstractions and frameworks for developing microservices and function chains. By changing how applications are programmed, new paradigms can enable the design of clean-slate application communication primitives that are both simple and efficient and simultaneously able to benefit from advanced hardware offloads like RDMA and in-network stream processing.
