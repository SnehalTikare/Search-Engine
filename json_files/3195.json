He received his PhD from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1994 and his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Sharif University of Technology in Tehran. Previously, Mashayek served as the director of graduate studies and the associate head of the department.  During Mashayek’s tenure as head, the department has nearly doubled in faculty size and has gained a Master of Energy Engineering program and an international master’s program called China 3+2 . In 2015, Mashayek developed the first five-year strategic plan for MIE. The plan focuses on growth in size and quality in the areas of education and research as well as improving the work climate within the department. The plan sets an ambitious goal of tripling the annual research expenditure in five years and has resulted so far in more than doubling the department’s annual research expenditure, PhD student enrollment, and journal publications.  At the campus level, Mashayek has taken a leading role in building and improving an infrastructure for high-performance computing and big data. He has been closely involved in establishing the policies for the first campus-wide computing cluster that was installed in 2014. He also serves as the principal investigator on two recent successful NSF grants to acquire and install UIC’s second shared computing cluster and enhance network and data transfer capabilities on campus.  Mashayek began his academic career by receiving an National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER Award and an Office of Naval Research (ONR) Young Investigator Award. In parallel with his administrative responsibilities, he maintains an active research program , which includes several active grants from federal agencies and industry. His research groupis at the forefront of state-of-the-art software development for numerical simulation of supersonic combustion in advanced engines that are under consideration for future hypersonic flights. On another front, his group has developed a new technology for generating high-quality liquid sprays using a novel method of electrostatic atomization. This technology is being transitioned for commercial use under two grants from a leading company in this area, in addition to an NSF grant to study and model the mechanism of charge injection inside these atomizers. Most recently, Mashayek started a new research effort on solid ion batteries. Mashayek’s research has been supported by NSF, ONR, the Air Force Research Laboratory, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Energy, Argonne National Laboratory, NASA, and several industry sponsors. Mashayek has published more than 280 articles, including 117 in archival journals.  Mashayek is a fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and an associate fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He has served as a member of the Mechanical Engineering Department Heads Executive Committee within ASME and on organizing committees of multiple conferences.       head contact      Farzad\n    \n    Mashayek  Professor, Department Head    Phone:   (312) 996-1154     Email:   mashayek@uic.edu      View Profile              Faculty and Staff           Department Head    Core Faculty    Affiliate Faculty    Emeritus Faculty    Staff    Open Positions                    ",
