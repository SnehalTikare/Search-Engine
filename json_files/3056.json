The intent of the recordings is to augment your learning; to allow self-review after attending a session in order to fill in any areas that may have been missed during the session. The decision to record a session rests with the individual instructor. As much notice as possible will be given when a session is not going to be recorded, however this can’t always be assured. In addition, there is always the possibility of technical problems which can result in the loss of the recorded material. The only way to be absolutely certain that you will be able to acquire all of the information from every session presented by the College is to attend in person. Recordings, notes, handouts, displays and any other material are protected by state common law and federal copyright law. You may not copy this material, provide copies of it to anyone else, or make use of it for any purpose other than personal review without prior permission from the faculty member (e.g. posting course materials to the student-run Google Drive, Facebook, Box, or other means of sharing content with students who are not enrolled in the course). This is a professionalism issue as well as a legal issue. TBL, core cases and other interactive sessions will not be recorded. Please refer to the calendar or BlackBoard to see which sessions will not be recorded.
