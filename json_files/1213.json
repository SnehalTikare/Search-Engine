UIC prohibits and will not tolerate sexual misconduct of or by students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC will take prompt and fair action to eliminate such conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects through interim protective measures and accommodations, equitable investigations, and disciplinary processes. Employees and students in violation of this policy may face sanctions up to and including termination or expulsion. The Office for Access and Equity, through its Title IX Coordinator, has the authority to conduct investigations, to determine when there have been violations of this policy based on the standard of preponderance of evidence, and then make recommendations in accordance with the relevant University policies for students, employees, patients, or visitors.  UIC encourages good faith reports of sexual misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any person who reports sexual misconduct and/or who participates in a Title IX investigation or resultant disciplinary process.  All employees are considered to be “Responsible Employees” with the authority and responsibility to report Sexual Misconduct to University Officials. Employees who are exempted from this reporting requirement are professional or pastoral counselors who provide work-related mental-health counseling, campus advocates who provide confidential victim assistance, and employees who are otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing information received in the course of providing professional care and treatment.  The PDF version of UIC's Comprehensive Policy regarding Dating Violence, Domestic Violence, Stalking and Sexual Assault is available for viewing or downloading.

Title IX states as follows:  No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.  Unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex includes: (a) sexual harassment, (b) gender-based harassment, which is unwelcome conduct based on actual or perceived sex, or harassment based on gender identity or nonconformity with sex stereotypes, and/or (c) all forms of sexual violence including, but not limited to, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, sexual coercion, sexual exploitation, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking (collectively referred to as “Sexual Misconduct”).  Sexual misconduct is the term used in this policy to encompass unwanted or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is committed without valid consent. Also included in this term is any abusive behavior that arises out of an actual or perceived intimate relationship (e.g. domestic or dating violence and stalking). Sexual misconduct may occur between people of the same gender or different gender identifications.
