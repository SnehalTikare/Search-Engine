The 63,000-square-foot center is home to 10 fabrication labs. What can you do there? Fabrication with electronics, plastic, metals, and textiles. You have access to rapid prototyping services, and there’s even a microfactory for small production runs.  mHUB is located at 965 W. Chicago Avenue in River West, about three blocks from the Chicago stop on the blue line and a 15-minute bike ride from campus.  Learn all about mHUB and its services here .  Activating your student membership   Complete the member onboarding form to register yourself in mHUB’s internal system. To receive the no-cost UIC membership, you must use your UIC email address when you sign up . Select “Associate Membership” (and don’t worry, you will not be charged the rate quoted to the general public for that membership level). When you go online to register, be prepared with a personal photo to upload.  Schedule a new member orientation session . mHUB holds these 30-minute sessions every Tuesday at 5:10 p.m. and every Thursday at 12:00 noon, and on the last Saturday of each month at 2 p.m. The orientation includes a chance to ask any questions you might have.  Before you attend the orientation session, review the membership agreement and code of conduct . You will be expected to sign these documents during orientation.  Attend the orientation session you selected. You will need to bring your UIC iCard with you when you attend orientation and any training sessions.  To access any equipment and/or labs, you must attend a general safety shop training . These 45-minute training sessions occur throughout the week and are offered immediately after any of the orientation slots.   Remember: To ensure that you receive the no-cost UIC student membership, you must use your UIC email address when you sign up, and you must bring your iCard when you attend the in-person orientation.  Questions?  Kristin Scally Roadman, economic development and innovation coordinator, is your best resource. You can email her at kscall2@uillinois.edu .
