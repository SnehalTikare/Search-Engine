The university has an interest in making sure this data is not inadvertently lost, whether by human error, equipment failure, or malware attack. The owners and administrators of these systems can request backup services.  Backups for servers, powered by IBM Spectrum Protect software, allows you to back up servers over the UIC campus network unattended and automatically. In the event of inadvertent deletion of one or more files, hard disk failure, or malware infection, backups can be used to restore your files.  To get started with backing up your departmental server, use the Request Server Backup link below and include the following information:    Description of your server: size, operating system, etc.  Your name, NetID, and names/NetIDs of other responsible administrators  You will be asked your server’s name, the name(s) and NetID(s) of  its responsible administrator(s), and some details about its size and its operating system         Quick Access             Request Server Backup            Install Windows Backup Client            Install Mac OS X Client                    Backup Status & Change Password             Contact Us          hide   AVAILABLE TO: Faculty | Staff  FUNDED BY : Basic Bundle       Answers  Features  More Info         Common Questions   Common Questions   How do I install and configure the ADSM backup client for Windows?  How do I install and configure the ADSM backup client for Mac OS X?  What do I do when I’m restoring files from ADSM backup and get error message ANS1410E?  Does UIC have a network backup service?  More…   Other Resources   Backup Status Tool            Features    Network Backup Service uses the IBM Spectrum Protect software, where a client program on your computer communicates with a server program at ACCC to run backups  You can easily set up automatic backups to run every night  Spectrum Protect runs in the background and should not affect the operation of your server if you happen to be using it while it is being backed up  The backup method is called “incremental forever,” where after an initial one-time full backup, only new and changed files are backed up thereafter, resulting in great efficiency  The Spectrum Protect server keeps track of your files in its database, and can reconstruct a full restore easily from these fragmentary backups made over time  Most backups are run at night, when they will not impact the performance of your server, though other backup schedules are available for special circumstances            More Info   Applicability  The ACCC Network Backup Service is offered only for UIC Chicago campus servers that are directly connected to the Chicago campus network by either Ethernet or WiFi. A fixed IP address is not necessary, it is compatible with DHCP.  Given the high volume of data that is transferred when using this service, backups cannot be used from off-campus or from any type of outside connection. It can be used over on-campus WiFi. It cannot be used over any type of modem, DSL or cable connection, even if physically located on campus. This can be a problem for campus buildings located north of the Eisenhower Expressway.  Requirements  Servers must be running a recent version of Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, Oracle Solaris, HPUX, or most editions of Linux. You must be authorized to install and run programs on the server, which is not possible with some self-contained file servers. You must have a high-bandwidth connection to the campus network, which is not possible in some older campus buildings.  More Information   Backup Status – a web application that shows you the date and time of last successful backup and allows you to sign up for daily email messages to keep you up to date with this information.  Network Backup Service: Introduction  Backup Client Installation  Backups for Servers Documentation   Compliance  Data being backed up is sent only over the campus network and is stored in ACCC’s locked, secured, and monitored facilities. The data media (disks and tapes) never leaves ACCC’s facilities on campus. Data is stored in an obscured form.  Sensitive information (e.g. subject to HIPAA, FERPA, etc) can be securely backed up by utilizing the encryption feature built into the client software. You can control which portions of your data to encrypt, and you keep the encryption keys. When you select this level of encryption, not even ACCC can decrypt your data.  ACCC treats all backed-up data as highly sensitive since the security level of the original data is often unknown. All worn-out media is disposed of securely by degaussing and physical destruction, regardless of what might have been stored on it.
