From our specialized Rural Medical Education, Urban Health and MD programs, to our continuing medical education course offerings, our programs reflect a commitment to positively impacting community-based medicine. Our students receive great training. Recognized for our challenging medical curriculum, the College’s MD program combines academic coursework with an extended, longitudinal ambulatory experience through our clinical clerkships. For more information, please contact us. Clinician Executive Medicine Program (CE-MED) The CE-MED course is a four-year longitudinal curriculum providing insights into the clinician executive skills and knowledge essential to addressing the complex leadership challenges resulting from healthcare organizational and health policy changes that impact the way clinicians provide care.  It emphasizes the importance of collaboration among clinician leaders and non-clinician administrative leaders in healthcare delivery organizations today and in the future. James Scholar Program The James Scholar Program for Independent Study focuses on supporting and refining research skills among medical students as they develop into physicians and clinical professionals. The program is designed to support outstanding medical student researchers during their M2-M4 years. Rural Medical Education Program (RMED) Our RMED program is offered as a supplement to the MD curriculum. Students in this program track are exposed to rural issues throughout their four years of medical school, participating in seminars, field trips and other assignments that focus on rural healthcare, family medicine and community-oriented primary care techniques. During the M4 year, RMED students engage in a 16-week preceptorship in a rural Illinois community. Research Opportunities for Students Students have many opportunities to participate in basic or clinical research. Click Here to read more.
