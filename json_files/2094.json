International Student, Scholar, and Employee Tax Obligations and Support - Filing Deadline, July 15 Updated: April 21, 2020     Each UIC\r\ninternational student, scholar, and employee present in the U.S. during\r\ncalendar year 2019 must file at least one tax document with the U.S. Internal\r\nRevenue Service (IRS) in order to meet their tax filing obligation and properly\r\nmaintain immigration status. Individuals who earned U.S.-based income must file\r\nadditional documentation. The general deadline for 2019 tax filings has been extended to July 15, 2020 .    While the\r\nOffice of International Services cannot directly advise individuals on their\r\nspecific tax filing obligations, the office has organized two valuable resources\r\nfor the UIC international community:    Sprintax Tax Preparation Software  OIS will\r\nagain provide the UIC international community with discounted access to\r\nSprintax, the online tax prep software for non-residents in the U.S. Get help\r\nfiling your personal U.S. federal and state tax returns and access Sprintax’s\r\ntax education library.     Current UIC international students and scholars - Access the Sprintax software by\r\n    logging into your my.uic.edu portal using your NetID and password. In the search bar in the upper right\r\n    corner, type “OSSS Applications.” In the OSSS Applications portlet, click\r\n    “OIS Tax Service” for complete instructions.  F-1 students currently on OPT, J-1 students on Academic\r\n    Training and UIC International Employees - OIS has sent an email to\r\n    the addresses we have on file for you which contains the instructions for\r\n    accessing Sprintax. If you have not received this email and believe you\r\n    should, please contact us at ois@uic.edu with your full name and UIN.     Tax Workshop for International Students,\r\nExchange Visitors and Employees  During this\r\nworkshop a local tax professional will provide an overview of non-immigrant tax\r\nresponsibilities and filing requirements. Please note that this workshop is\r\ngeneral in focus and not intended to provide one-on-one tax preparation\r\nservices or advice nor will it cover how to use the Sprintax tax preparation\r\nsoftware.
