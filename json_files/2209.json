International Travel Guidance for the UIC International Community The Office\r\nof International Services understands that many members of the international\r\ncommunity may be feeling uncertainty and stress as a result of the\r\ncoronavirus/COVD-19 outbreak and the ever-changing news and recommendations\r\nsurrounding it. We are a global community with loved ones around the world and\r\ninternational travel is part of our lives. Know that OIS is always here to\r\nsupport you and help you navigate the resources you may need. Please call (312)\r\n996-3121 or email ( ois@uic.edu ) us with any\r\nconcerns you may have. We are here to listen, help and connect.    The\r\nremainder of this message is to share our international travel recommendations\r\nfor the UIC international community. Please continue to check today.uic.edu/coronavirus which will be updated regularly to keep the UIC community notified with the\r\nmost relevant information regarding COVID-19. Our OIS recommendations are made\r\nwithin the context of guidance from the University and the Centers for\r\nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) . Additionally, we have taken\r\ninto account the possibility for additional international travel restrictions\r\nenacted by the U.S. and other governments along with disrupted visa services at\r\nU.S. Embassies and Consulates abroad. The immigration environment surrounding\r\nthis outbreak is changing quickly and it is not possible to predict exactly\r\nwhen travel or visa restrictions will occur.     In light of\r\nguidance and the volatile immigration environment, the Office of International Services is strongly discouraging all\r\ninternational students, scholars and employees from traveling outside the U.S. in\r\nthe near future , including during\r\nthe upcoming spring break period.    If you are considering international\r\ntravel, review your immigration documents immediately. If your visa has\r\nexpired, you will need to renew it while abroad. Consult the webpage of the U.S.\r\nEmbassy or Consulate nearest your destination and confirm that visa\r\nservices remain open and note processing times. Review the OIS website for additional\r\ninformation about documents and travel.    Individuals who choose to travel outside\r\nthe U.S. should closely monitor their symptoms upon returning to campus and\r\ncontact UIC healthcare providers immediately if they experience fever, cough or\r\nshortness of breath. Students should contact Student Health at University\r\nVillage (312) 996-2901 and employees should contact University Health Service\r\nat (312) 996-7420 during business hours or the University of Illinois Hospital at\r\n(866) 600-2273 after hours. Additionally, monitor the CDC\r\nInformation for Travel page regularly and self-quarantine if your\r\ntravel location is added to list of CDC Travel Alert Level 3 countries during\r\nyour trip or within 14 days of your return to campus.    Individuals who choose to travel to a\r\ncountry with a CDC Travel\r\nAlert Level 3 (currently China, Iran, South Korea and Italy)\r\nshould self-quarantine for 14 days upon their return, regardless of symptoms.\r\nSelf-quarantine means staying home and avoiding contact with others even if you\r\ndo not have a fever, cough or shortness of breath. If symptoms do present\r\nduring the period of self-quarantine, contact UIC healthcare providers as\r\nlisted above.    UIC students who must self-quarantine due to experiencing symptoms or as a result of travel to a CDC Travel Alert 3\r\ncountry should notify their instructors via email or phone. UIC faculty and\r\nstaff should notify their supervisors. Members of the UIC international\r\ncommunity must also contact the Office of International Services via email\r\n(ois@uic.edu) or phone (312) 996-3121 for additional support and guidance with\r\nregards to maintaining immigration status.    Lastly, OIS cannot guarantee our ability to\r\nintervene on the behalf of international students, faculty or staff who choose\r\nto travel to a CDC Travel Alert 3 country and are unable to return to\r\ncampus due to travel restrictions or visa delays. Currently, travel to the U.S.\r\nis only restricted from China and Iran but this list could likely change as the\r\noutbreak progresses.    We\r\nunderstand that the decision to travel is personal and circumstances are\r\ndifferent for each case. If you absolutely must travel outside the U.S. with an\r\nintention to return to campus, please review the\r\nOffice of the Provost’s recent message carefully and contact OIS\r\nwith any questions or doubts.       Questions?\r\nFeel free to contact the Office of International Services.         xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?
