In the past, I have investigated various methods for automatic verification of these systems using such models as finite automata and Petri nets. In recent years, I have shifted my main research focus to the automatic generation of control supervisors for discrete manufacturing systems. For instance, I codirected NIST-sponsored project seeking to generate automatically supervisory controllers for discrete manufacturing plants. More generally, I am now interested in techniques for supervisory control and dynamic reconfiguration of discrete event systems. An additional application is the automatic correction of multi-threaded Java programs required to be free of deadlock and to comply with user-specified safety properties. Additional interests include software development for multicore hardware, mobile app development, and sensor networks.  Teaching:  I usually teach courses on object-oriented programming languages (CS 342 and CS 474), software engineering (CS 342, CS 440, CS 442 and CS 540), and mobile app development (CS 478). In the past, I have also taught introductory computer-science classes (CS 100 and CS 101), data structures (CS 201), and theory classes (CS 301 and CS 401).  List of courses that I taught:   CS 100  CS 101  CS 201  CS 301  CS 342  CS 401  CS 440  CS 442  CS 474  CS 478  CS 540  CS 594   Professional Activities:   Organization committee member for Petri Nets '93, 14th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets, Chicago, Illinois, June, 1993.  Program committee member for ICCI'93 Fifth International Conference on Computing and Information, Sudbury, Ontario, May, 1993.  Program committee member for IWSSD-7 IEEE Seventh International Workshop on Software Specification and Design, Redondo Beach, California, December, 1993.  Program committee member for IWSSD-8 IEEE Eighth International Workshop on Software Specification and Design, Paderborn, Germany, March, 1996.
