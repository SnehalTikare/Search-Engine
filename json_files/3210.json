This is an excellent time to be a researcher in these fields at UIC. The department was recently the beneficiary of a generous grant from donors Richard and Loan Hill—a contribution that has enabled UIC to increase its ranks of renowned faculty, invest significantly in new research, and assume a more prominent role in the global bioengineering community.  Working in UIC bioengineering and bioinformatics labs allows you to develop your own research agenda in your specific area of interest. The faculty you may work with are actively involved in investigations in the following focus areas:   Bioinformatics  Biomaterials  Biomechanics  Biomedical imaging  Biomolecular engineering  Bionanotechnology  Cell and tissue engineering  Computational modeling  Microtechnology  Neural Engineering  Ophthalmology  Rehabilitation Engineering   We encourage you to explore our labs page to delve into the specific research projects underway at UIC and to see how you might get involved.  Graduates of UIC doctoral programs in bioengineering and bioinformatics have gone on to tenure-track faculty or postdoctoral research positions at top universities, such as Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, and the University of Minnesota, and to industry positions at companies from Bayer Pharmaceuticals to Intel to Hospira.
