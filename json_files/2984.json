    "contents": "  Generalized Conditional Gradient (GCG)     Overview  GCG is an open source Matlab solver for gauge (norm)\nregularized problems, that are commonly used in sparse coding and\ncompressive sensing.  Examples include matrix completion,\ndictionary learning, and structured sparse estimation. The code includes the implementations used for all experiments in [1]. Download Latest: GCG version 2.0  Old stuff: GCG version 1.0  This version 1.0 implements the boosting algorithm in [2].\nNote the loss\nfunction for matrix completion needs to be customized in order to\nefficiently compute f(U V') where U and V have a small number of\ncolumns.  We provide a helper function here .
