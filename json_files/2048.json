02/28/2017 OIS NEWS - 05/24/2017 Coronavirus/COVID-19 Updates for the UIC International Community TN (Professionals Under NAFTA)   Work Authorization  Immigration Documents  Renewals and Validity Period  Intent  TDs  Address Changes  Taxes  Travel and Visa Process  Grace Periods  Portability  Departure  Unlawful Presence      Work Authorization    Work only in the authorized place of\n    employment and for the period approved in your TN invitation letter and\n    I-94. If your job ends sooner than the invitation letter end date, your\n    status ends on the same day. See Grace Periods below.  Have the department notify OIS if significant\n    change in duties, responsibilities, salary or work site is expected during\n    your authorized employment. An amended petition may be necessary.  Do not accept additional employment or work at\n    an additional location without consulting with OIS in advance.  You can have more than one TN sponsor,\n    but this requires either a separate I-129 filing to USCIS or a reentry\n    with new employer sponsor letters shown to U.S. Customs and Border\n    Protection (CBP).      Immigration Documents    Maintain a valid passport at all times, valid\n    for at least six months into the future.  Retain copies of all immigration documents\n    including: current and expired passports, Forms I-797, I-94, etc.  The I-797 approval notice is your property (if applicable); there is a fee to request a duplicate I-797 approval, if lost.   I-94 : Always review and save your new I-94\n    after reentry at: www.cbp.gov/I94 .    Form I-94 must indicate \"Admitted as:\n        TN\" and “Admitted until date” that matches your invitation letter or\n        I-797 approval.  Note: Individuals from Mexico entering the U.S. in TN status are\n        often entered for only 1 year.  Incorrect end date : If your I-94 indicates any\n        other expiration date, contact OIS.  Passport expiry within six\n        months is a common reason for a shortened I-94. If this occurs, consult\n        with OIS.       Renewals and Validity Period    Your department will need to initiate the TN\n    extension process 2-4 months prior to your TN expiry date. Keep in mind that TN\n    status can be extended indefinitely in three year increments.      Intent    TN status is a non-immigrant status,\n    which means your intent to remain in the United States is temporary. If your department\n    is interested in sponsoring you for permanent residency, contact OIS to discuss\n    possible options. You may also consult our “ Use of\n    Attorneys Policy ” and “ UIC\n    Sponsorship of Permanent Immigrant Visas ” information.       TDs    TD dependents are not eligible to work, or volunteer\n    to work. They may attend school. Consult OIS if you have questions.      Address Changes    Report any change in residential address,\n    within 10 days of moving, to USCIS ( Form\n    AR-11 ), to OIS by email ois@uic.edu , and via\n    UIC’s My\n    Profile page.      Taxes    Individuals in TN status are required to file\n    both state and federal taxes.      Travel and Visa Process    Canadian Citizens :   No visa\n        stamp is required for entry to the U.S.  Present the\n        following at the port of entry: TN invitation letter completed by the\n        department and approved by OIS, valid Canadian passport, TN application\n        fee, evidence of degree showing that you qualify for the position,\n        evidence that your stay is temporary in nature, original I-797 approval notice, if applicable.    Mexican Citizens :   Visa stamp required – review required\n        consulate-specific documents.  Schedule an appointment with the U.S.\n        Consulate/Embassy and complete Form DS-160 with\n        fee.  Review consulate/embassy website for\n        guidance about required documents. We suggest bringing:   Passport\n            (valid for six months beyond reentry date)  TN\n            invitation letter completed by the department and approved by OIS  Evidence\n            of degree showing you qualify for the position  Evidence\n            that your stay in the U.S. remains temporary in nature  Original I-797 approval notice, if applicable     TD dependents :   In addition to the above, they should bring\n        proof of their dependent status (marriage or birth certificate) as well as\n        evidence that their stay remains temporary.       Grace Periods    You have a 10-day grace period after the end\n    date of your stay in TN status. You may not work during this period; it is\n    time to prepare to leave the U.S., change status, etc.  If your department ends your employment before\n    end date of the TN invitation you may remain in the U.S. for 60 days, or\n    until your petition end date (whichever is sooner) and have a new sponsor\n    file a petition for you. See “portability” below.      Portability    It is possible to “port”/“transfer” your TN\n    status to another employer; the new employer will file a Form I-129 on your\n    behalf. Employment should be continuous from UIC to the next employer. If your\n    department ends your employment early, you may have up to 60 days to remain in\n    the country and seek other employment. You may not work or volunteer during the\n    transitional time. Your future TN sponsor will advise you on this process and\n    notify you when you may begin your new employment. Alternatively, you could\n    travel to change employers.      Departure    You must submit a Departure\n    Verification Form upon completion of employment. This form is\n    required regardless of your departure reason: leaving the U.S.,\n    changing employers, or changing immigration status.      Unlawful Presence    This occurs when you stay beyond the ending\n    date of your I-94 or upon determination by Department of Homeland Security. Consequences\n    include a 3-year bar from reentering the U.S. if you have stayed unlawfully in\n    the U.S. for 180 days or more, and a 10-year bar if you remain unlawfully in\n    the U.S. for 360 days or more. Violation of your TN status makes you ineligible\n    for any immigration benefits. This does not apply if a timely, non-frivolous\n    petition to extend your stay has been received by the USCIS prior to the end\n    date of your I-94.                xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?
