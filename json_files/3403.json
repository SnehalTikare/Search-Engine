UIC Business is committed to supporting a talented, well-rounded, hardworking, and diverse student body throughout their undergraduate and graduate education. While students with financial need often receive assistance from government resources, it is almost never enough. Merit and need-based scholarships are essential in attracting and retaining UIC Business students.       Scholarships     General Scholarship Support   Annual scholarship contributions of any size can be made to the UIC Business Scholarship Fund , which provides general scholarship support to undergraduate and graduate business students that exhibit academic excellence and demonstrate financial need.     Named Endowed Scholarships   Donors can establish named endowed scholarships with gift commitments of $25,000 or more. Endowed scholarships can be designated to support a student who reflects your interests and values, or awarded to any deserving student with financial need.
