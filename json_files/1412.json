It provides integrated authentication and authorization to systems and services across the Chicago and regional campuses.

More…           Features             Built-in Account Management  The UIC Active directory features a full set of user accounts for all UIC students, staff, and faculty. The ACCC will monitor and maintain all user accounts in a central branch of the AD tree, thus relieving individual departments of this responsibility.    Synchronized Passwords  When using ACCC-maintained AD accounts, its users will have the same password for Active Directory, email, other ACCC services, and many secure UIC websites. The ACCC provides a web page for account management in AD and other ACCC-offered services.    Reduced Cost  The ACCC has invested in the hardware and software to provide the UIC campus with a reliable AD infrastructure. This allows departments to leverage AD without the expense of servers and time in maintaining network infrastructure.\n\nThe ACCC maintains servers hosting our Root and AD.UIC.EDU domains in the UIC AD forest. The ACCC also provides the back end FSMO and DNS servers needed to provide services in the Active Directory at UIC.    Autonomy and Control  Even though the UIC AD is centrally managed, departments may elect to have their own branch in the Active Directory tree. This will give the department the flexibility to publish computing resources and file shares on department-owned servers. The departmental branches are secured from the rest of the AD forest and departments will have full control of their branch. Departments can add containers, servers, objects, and organizational units under their top level Organizational Unit (OU) as needed. This gives the flexibility to organize unit data and resources according to your departmental structure.    Support  The ACCC provides various levels of support with regard to the UIC AD forest. ACCC administrators are available for consulting and problem tracking should you have technical issues with your departmental branch. The ACCC gives the UIC AD forest top priority when allocating consulting and support resources. The ACCC also maintains a reactive and proactive support contract with Microsoft Premier Support for the Active Directory.    Savings  By using the central services offered by the ACCC, departmental administrators can focus on improving rather than maintaining IT resources. REACH and IT support personnel are freed from the day-to-day maintenance of users and accounts. This can allow IT support staff to spend more time developing and expanding computing resources at the departmental level. The ACCC's goal is to lower the cost of using Active Directory on the UIC campus. This will allow departments to address specific computing needs by spending money on active computing resources instead of infrastructure.              More Info   Requirements  A UIC department or college will sponsor each Organizational Unit. OU administrators will be asked to provide documentation of their current network / OS environment before their OU is created. OU administration support from ACCC is billed at an hourly rate of $55 / hour.   More Info  The following departments are leveraging the benefits of the UIC AD forest on a daily basis:   • ACCC Public Computing Labs • ACCC Enterprise Architecture and Development Group • Office of the Chancellor • College of Medicine • College of Pharmacy • Applied Health Sciences • UIC Multimedia Classrooms (ACCC-maintained)              Google Maps image     C-Stop, BSB   1007 West Harrison Street,  Behavioral Sciences Building (BSB), Learning Center, First Floor,  Chicago,  IL    Phone: (312) 413-0003  Website: https://accc.uic.edu/support         Service Level Agreement       Service Request Fulfillment Time  2 business days    Incident Resolution Time  1 business day    Service Availability  24x7    Maintenance Window(s)  Wednesday morning from 3:00am to 6:00am.​Approved ACCC maintenance window(s)    Service Notification Channel(s)  ACCC Service Notices, REACH distribution email list    Reviewed to Ensure SLA Meets Business Requirements  Provisional SLA - Currently under IT Governance review    Date Reviewed  Provisional SLA - Currently under IT Governance review    Service Owner: Ed Zawacki               Services           Communication and Collaboration     Cloud Storage     Box    Google Drive    OneDrive      Conferencing     Blackboard Collaborate    Google Meet    Webex Meetings    Zoom      Digital Signage     Industry Weapon      Email and Calendaring     Exchange    Gmail    Google Calendar    Listserv      Emergency Communications     Startel    UIC Alert      Instant Messaging     Jabber      Phone Services     Automatic Call Distribution    Mobile Devices    Telephones    Voicemail      Productivity Software     G Suite    Office 365      Virtual Collaboration Spaces     Google Chat    Microsoft Teams      Website Services     Google Sites    Microsoft IIS    People.uic.edu    SharePoint    Webhost.uic.edu        Computing Services     Device Charging     Recharge Stations      Endpoint Management     Jamf    SCCM      Printing     U-Print    Wepa      Software Licensing and Sales     Software Licensing        Infrastructure     Backups     ADSM    CrashPlan      Cloud Computing     Azure      Colocation Server Hosting     Data Center      Database Services     MS SQL    MySQL      Network     Data Jacks    Domain Name System    Guest Wireless    Residence Hall Network    Virtual Private Network    Wired Network    Wireless Network      Storage     Active Directory Desktop Advantage    Active Directory Network Storage      Virtual Machines     Linux Virtual Machine    Windows Virtual Machine        Professional Services     Desktop Support     Contracted Support    Hourly Service Calls      Device Maintenance     Personal Device Maintenance      Event Support     Event Support (Audio/Visual)      IT Memberships     Corporate Executive Board    Educause    Gartner    REACH      Professional Development and Training     AVIXA    Online Training    Webinars and Workshops      Ticketing System     Request Tracker        Research     Research Computing     High Performance Computing    Secure Computing Environment      Research Networks     High-Performance Research Network      Surveys for Research     Qualtrics        Security     Account Administration     NetID Activation    UIC Account Portal      Antivirus     Symantec Endpoint Protection    System Center Endpoint Protection      Authentication     2-Factor Authentication    Active Directory    Bluestem    Shibboleth Framework      Certificates     SSL/TLS Certificates      Directory Services     Active Directory    DeptUpdate    Online Directory      Encryption     Bitlocker    PGP Desktop      Event Logging     Splunk      Identity Management     Affiliations    UIN      Password Management     NetID Password Manager    Secondary NetID Password Manager      Role-Based Authorization     Liaison Manager    PbUpdate        Teaching and Learning     Active Learning Systems     Echo360 Engagement    iClicker    Poll Everywhere    Wireless Collaboration and Presentation      Anti-Plagiarism     iThenticate    SafeAssign      Digital Textbooks     Open Educational Resources    RedShelf    VitalSource      eLearning Authoring    Equipment Lending     Extended Laptop Loan    Short-Term Lending      Learning Environments     Classrooms    Computer Labs      Learning Management System     Blackboard Learn      Lecture Capture     Echo360 Platform    Panopto      Media Streaming     Echo360 Platform    Google Drive    Panopto      Multimedia Production     Lightboard Studio    Media Conversion      Online Proctoring     Respondus      Surveys     Blackboard Surveys    Google Forms                        ",
