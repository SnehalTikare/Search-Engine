Hear From Our Students        “I loved UIC TIE program! The teachers were great. I did just one medium-intermidiate level session in the Spring, which was enough for me to start taking undergraduate classes at a community college in the Fall of the same year. I learned so much in a very short time. Excellent English program as I am now a nurse and in grad school :). I am very proud to say that I went to one of the best ESL classes in Chicago. I would definitely recommend it”    Jaqueline Silva | Brazil | Nurse          “The best place in Chicago for international students from all around the World to come to learn English. Everyone here is just simply amazing. I love this place.”    Anh Dang | Vietnam                         ",
