Prior to joining UIC, I was at UC Berkeley Simons Institute and Microsoft Research. I recieved my Ph.D. in 2016 from Columbia University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Xi Chen.  My research is in theoretical computer science. More specifically, I work in parallel algorithms, sublinear algorithms and graph algorithms.  Research Interests:  Design and analysis of algorithms with an emphasis on big data processing, including algorithmic graph theory, massively parallel computing and machine learning theory     Selected Publications    The Query Complexity of Graph Isomorphism: Bypassing Distribution Testing Lower Bounds  Krzysztof Onak , Xiaorui Sun STOC 2018  Probability-Revealing Samples  Krzysztof Onak , Xiaorui Sun AISTATS 2018  Linear Regression Without Correspondence Daniel Hsu, Kevin Shi, Xiaorui Sun NIPS 2017  Correspondence retrieval Alexandr Andoni, Daniel Hsu, Kevin Shi, Xiaorui Sun COLT 2017  Efficient Massively Parallel Methods for Dynamic Programming  Sungjin Im , Benjamin Moseley , Xiaorui Sun STOC 2017  Faster Canonical Forms for Primitive Coherent Configurations [arxiv] Xiaorui Sun, John Wilmes STOC 2015 Invited to the SIAM Journal on Computing Special Issue  On the Complexity of Optimal Lottery Pricing and Randomized Mechanisms  Xi Chen , Ilias Diakonikolas , Anthi Orfanou , Dimitris Paparas , Xiaorui Sun, Mihalis Yannakakis FOCS 2015  Near-Optimal Density Estimation in Near-Linear Time Using Variable-Width Histograms [nips]  Siu On Chan , Ilias Diakonikolas , Rocco Servedio , Xiaorui Sun NIPS 2014  Efficient Density Estimation via Piecewise Polynomial Approximation [arxiv]  Siu On Chan , Ilias Diakonikolas , Rocco Servedio , Xiaorui Sun STOC 2014  Blog post about this work: MIT theory student blog   A Composition Theorem for Parity Kill Number [arxiv]  Ryan O’Donnell , Xiaorui Sun, Li-Yang Tan , John Wright , Yu Zhao CCC 2014  The Complexity of Optimal Multidimensional Pricing [arxiv]  Xi Chen , Ilias Diakonikolas , Dimitris Paparas , Xiaorui Sun, Mihalis Yannakakis SODA 2014  Faster Canonical Forms For Strongly Regular Graphs [pdf]  László Babai , Xi Chen , Xiaorui Sun, Shang-Hua Teng , John Wilmes FOCS 2013 Invited to the SIAM Journal on Computing Special Issue  Multi-Stage Propagation and Quasipolynomial-Time Isomorphism Testing of Steiner 2-System  Xi Chen , Xiaorui Sun, Shang-Hua Teng STOC 2013  Learning Mixtures of Structured Distributions over Discrete Domains [arxiv]  Siu On Chan , Ilias Diakonikolas , Rocco A.
