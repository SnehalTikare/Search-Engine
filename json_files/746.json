Which semesters can I start?   The Weekend MBA Program and the Accelerated MBA start in the fall semester only. Students in the flexible program can start in the summer, fall or spring.        What is the difference between online courses and traditional on-campus courses?         What is the difference between online courses and traditional on-campus courses?   Online courses are often very different than traditional on-campus courses in terms of how the material is presented, the nature of the interaction among class members and the overall learning experience. However, the course load is at the same level as the face-to-face version; the only amount of time saved is your commute time to and from campus. Our online courses use the Blackboard software. Select courses are offered online, and offerings vary each semester.        Does UIC offer an Online MBA?         Does UIC offer an Online MBA?   UIC does not offer an exclusively online MBA degree. Online coursework is offered for five of the 14 courses required to complete an MBA (remaining courses typically have evening and weekend offering times to make it convenient for working professionals). Our campus-based MBA delivers deep and interactive class discussions that encourage critical thinking and problem solving, and promotes networking, team projects and campus involvement.        Should I apply even though I do not have any work experience?         Should I apply even though I do not have any work experience?   MBA applicants are expected to have at least two years of business related work experience after the completion of a 4-year bachelor’s degree. Historically, our typical admitted student had more than this level of experience prior to applying to the UIC Business MBA program.        How do I apply for a joint degree program?         How do I apply for a joint degree program?   Applicants may apply to a joint degree program during the initial application process, or they may apply to their second program upon gaining admission and enrolling in their first program.  First time applicants to UIC wishing to enroll in a joint degree program are required to apply separately to both programs, making sure to follow the application procedures/requirements for each program.  Current UIC graduate students interested in applying to a joint degree program should work closely with academic advisers in both programs and visit Business Connnect for additional instruction.        Do I need an undergraduate degree in business to be accepted into the program?         Do I need an undergraduate degree in business to be accepted into the program?   An undergraduate degree in business administration is not required. In fact, our Accelerated MBA Program is designed specifically for those with an undergraduate background in a non-business field. Approximately 50% of our student body does not have an undergraduate business background. We do recommend that students have had a class in statistics. If they have not, they can take one during their first semester.        Can I take courses as a non-degree seeking student?         Can I take courses as a non-degree seeking student?   You may be admitted to the Liautaud MBA Program on a non-degree basis only in the following two cases:  1. If you have already completed an MBA or other approved management degree from an AACSB accredited institution and wish to pursue further course work, you may enroll in MBA classes on a space-available basis as long as you maintain good academic standing. The application for admission and proof of MBA degree (a photocopy of your transcript or diploma showing a completed MBA degree) must be submitted by the application deadline for the desired term of study.  2. If you are currently enrolled in an MBA program at another AACSB institution and wish to take courses that will be accepted by your university as transfer courses, you may enroll in MBA courses to the extent approved by your MBA program and by the MBA Program. The MBA application for admission, application fee, proof of baccalaureate degree and letter from the director of your MBA program indicating that you are in good academic standing and list the courses approved to be transferred must be submitted by the application deadline for the desired term of study. You may also be asked by the admissions committee to provide additional information regarding your academic credentials.
