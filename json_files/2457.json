Once your account has been created, you can sign in anytime using your UIC credentials.       Requesting a ride   After tapping the icon and signing in to your TransLōc account, click the Request a Ride button.  Enter the address where you would like to be picked-up. There are multiple ways to input an address:  Type the address into the search bar.  Click the My Addresses drop-down and select the address from the list. If you do not have any saved addresses, you can add them to the system.  Move the pin on the map by dragging the map on the screen. The location of the green pin is where you’ll be picked-up.    Enter the address where you would like to be dropped-off.       View ride status  Once you’ve scheduled a ride, click View Ride and you will be taken to a live map showing your pickup and drop-off locations along with the vehicle itself.  This page also displays your estimated pickup time.  A text message will be sent to the phone number you provided for your account (Note: you will not receive text messages if you did not provide a mobile phone number for your account). This message will be sent between 3-5 minutes prior to the vehicle arriving to your pickup location, giving you plenty of time to prepare and be waiting for the vehicle.
