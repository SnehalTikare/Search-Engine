The UIC Department of Kinesiology and Nutrition produces leading experts in the fields of health, fitness and nutrition. Our graduates work with professional athletes, for major healthcare institutions, in fitness and wellness facilities, and for therapeutic and rehabilitation systems.  Kinesiology , the study of body movement, focuses on the human body and how it functions. Multiple career fields use kinesiology, such as physical therapy, rehabilitation science and athletic training.  Nutrition focuses on healthy eating and the dietary requirements to maintain wellness and fight disease. A vital part of the healthcare industry, nutritionists practice in areas such as health sciences, rehabilitation and counseling.  Our programs range from undergraduate to the doctoral level, preparing students for successful careers in allied health or continuing their education with advanced degrees.
