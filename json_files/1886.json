Our curriculum is comprehensively developed and specifically designed to encompass the knowledge base and skill set required in the present-day construction engineering and management profession. The program is geared for students who plan to rise into higher roles in construction management—those who not only execute the required work, but who have the capacity to lead teams and oversee projects.  Contact us: Hossein Ataei, PhD , Program Director | Sara Arevalo , Graduate Coordinator       Who should apply?      This program is ideal for a wide range of professionals and recent college graduates who want to develop their technical knowledge and field-specific competencies.  You may be a strong candidate for this new MS program if you are:   A mid-career or experienced construction management professional who is interested in positioning yourself for further career advancement  A recent graduate of an undergraduate program in civil engineering, construction management, or a related discipline at UIC or another university  A military veteran or current/former military engineer who seeks to make the transition to a civilian-side position  An engineering professional who anticipates taking on greater responsibilities in construction project management and engineering leadership   Applicants must have a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university in an engineering field—for example, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, industrial engineering—or in mathematics or physics.  Applicants must also demonstrate a satisfactory cumulative undergraduate GPA (grade point average) and satisfactory performance in previous coursework related to their major.       Topics Covered   When students complete the program requirements , we expect they will have comprehensive knowledge in these areas:      Topics Covered:    Budgeting and estimating  Claims and dispute resolution  Construction accounting and financing  Construction industry in the United States and abroad  Construction equipment and methods  Construction laws and regulations  Construction project controls  Construction quality control and safety management  Construction scheduling      More topics    Ethics and professional issues in construction engineering  Managing risk in construction  Managing stakeholders  Organizational behavior and human resources management in the construction engineering industry  Procurement management  Project life cycle  Project planning  Sustainability and environmental management          Program requirements for  MS in Construction Engineering and Management       Faculty and Location       The program director, Dr. Hossein Ataei , teaches the required core courses alongside colleagues from the Department of Civil and Materials Engineering.  All lectures are delivered in classrooms on UIC’s east campus, just a few minutes outside the core of downtown Chicago. Our campus is accessible via the CTA blue line as well as a number of CTA bus routes. On-site parking is available for a fee, on either a daily basis or semester basis, for registered graduate students.  Students have access to department and university computer labs, including a full suite of civil engineering software: AutoCAD and Civil 3D, the Autodesk Building Information Modeling package (REVIT, Navisworks, and BIM 360), ARC-GIS, HECRAS, the Microsoft Office and MS Project suites, and more.        Career Advancement      The MS in Construction Engineering and Management at UIC is a degree designed for professionals, and therefore your career advancement is paramount.   Strong partnerships and collaborations with industry inspired the creation of this program and the development of its curriculum. Advantages include:  Our technical courses are career-focused and practical. We offer many of them in problem-based learning formats, in addition to classic formats that consist of lectures, projects, and exams.  Students develop project portfolios based on the work they complete in the program. These portfolios are valuable in the career search process, highlighting each student’s knowledge base, skill sets, and certifications.  We emphasize the importance of interacting with industry. Guest speakers from companies and agencies in the Chicago area will enhance students’ professional networks and understanding of the field. Students will have the opportunity to actively engage in engineering activities that serve the public and develop their skills.  We encourage our students to apply for professional certifications and licensure that will enable them to achieve their goals. This may include LEED certification, Project Management Professional certification, Certified Construction Manager status, and Certified International Project Manager status.  We have established a UIC-based chapter of the Construction Management Association of America , which provides networking opportunities.
