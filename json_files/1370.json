There are additional bandwidth and file-sharing limitations on the networks, described in the Acceptable Use Policy for Res-Net and the UIC Public Wireless Networks.  Requirements  Res-Net service is automatically available to current UIC students or staff members residing in any of the campus residence halls and have a valid UIC NetID and common password.  Res-Net service is contingent upon acceptance and compliance with both the ACCC Acceptable Use Policy and the UIC Wireless and Res-Net Policy . Failure to abide by these policies will result in revocation of Res-Net service and/or use of ACCC account. Note in the UIC Wireless and Res-Net Policy the daily bandwidth limitation on Res-Net use (as well as the public wireless networks on campus).  Cost  Res-Net charges are part of the Campus Housing contract. Campus Housing charges residents a Technology Access fee which allows access to cable television, wired, and wireless internet connections in the residence halls.

Printing in Res-Net uses the same system and has the same charges as printing in the ACCC campus personal computer labs .
