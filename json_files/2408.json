The Honors College Vision   By providing an innovative curriculum and promoting engagement with faculty and the resources of UIC, the Honors College will stand out among its peers by preparing global leaders able to shape a just society in the 21 st century.

Essential benefits of being a member of the Honors College include:   Specialized topics based courses, lectures, and seminars taught by premiere faculty  Increased opportunities to participate in undergraduate research  All students are assigned a Faculty Fellow to provide deeper mentorship in their field of study  Chance to participate in student organizations led by Honors students (see HCAB, SFP, Red Shoes, CCP?)
