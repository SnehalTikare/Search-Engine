The award recognizes outstanding student leaders and volunteers who, while maintaining high academic achievement, demonstrate a commitment to the UIC community through participation in student organizations and campus activities and throughout the greater Chicagoland area through active service and community engagement.  “Congratulations to Hardik on a well-deserved honor,” said William A. Ryan, clinical associate professor and director of the MEE program. “A December 2018 graduate of the Master of Energy Engineering program, he was an active, hard-working student with many accomplishments, and the most active president that ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) branch has had in many years.”  As the 2018 president of the UIC ASHRAE Branch, Miyani increased student membership and organized technical presentations in which industry professionals shared their expertise. He volunteered to speak with parents and high school graduates about ASHRAE and career opportunities in engineering, and served on the planning committee as an active member of the Young Engineers in ASHRAE (YEA) Illinois chapter. While participating in extra-curricular activities, he ensured that his studies were not affected and maintained a grade point average of 4.0 during his graduate studies  In addition to the Chancellor’s Student Service and Leadership Award, Miyani won three awards during 2018, which included the International District Energy Association (IDEA) John Gray Award, Midwest Renewable Energy Association (MREA) & Straubel Foundation Clean Energy Leadership Award, and the ASHRAE Illinois Chapter Scholarship.  After graduation, Miyani landed a position at ESD Global, which is a Chicago-based consulting-engineering firm focused on the delivery of high-performance buildings. The company delivers value by creating healthy and productive environments and designing facilities that are more cost effective, flexible, reliable, and sustainable.  The Master of Energy Engineering program in the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at UIC is a unique program designed for those interested in the growing energy industry. The curriculum provides a diverse course offering reflecting industry concerns such as energy efficiency, creating buildings that are energy efficient, power generation, the grid, management of engineering projects, HVAC design, renewable energy, and other energy issues. All classes are taught in the evening on the UIC campus.  Learn more about the program at http://energyengineering.uic.edu .      Modified on June 02, 2019                     ",
