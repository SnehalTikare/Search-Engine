The UIC team, led by Peter Nelson, PhD, dean of the College and professor of computer science, and Alex Leow, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry and bioengineering, won semi-final and final rounds to develop their prototype through Apple’s open-source platform called ResearchKit and test it among users through Apple’s TestFlight app. BiAffect will receive $200,000 to launch publicly in the App Store and help advance bipolar research.
