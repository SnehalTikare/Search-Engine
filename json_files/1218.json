CAN is welcoming of all gender identities and is sensitive to how culture and social identities can shape the experience of violence. Advocates work together with survivors to identify available options, explain the benefits and drawbacks of each option, and help survivors navigate the options - both on and off campus, that they choose.Â  Support is provided even when no legal, civil or administrative action is taken. CAN is a place where individuals can make anonymous and confidential campus crime reports.
