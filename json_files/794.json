The UIC Institute for the Humanities will celebrate its thirty-eighth year of operation in 2020-2021. Founded in 1983, the Institute is one of the oldest humanities centers in the United States. Over the years the Institute has become the major hub for all humanities activities on campus creating an intellectual space in which faculty and graduate students can broaden their perspectives, conduct original research, and engage with scholars and communities both in and outside the university.    ***Dear Colleagues,  Given concerns over the COVID-19 spread, Institute for the Humanities is making alternate plans for the remaining events of the semester. While some talks may be streamed, other events that will potentially bring together large groups of people will either be cancelled or postponed.  Please stay tuned for further information as alternate plans are finalized.***        Upcoming SP20 Digital Humanities Events           Live Q&A with DHI Experts  Troubleshooting the Virtual Classroom (Round 3) [Tue, April 28, 1-2 pm]             Humanities in a Pandemic: Resources for COVID-19  Responses from in the Consortium of Humanities Institutes and Centers (CHCI).
