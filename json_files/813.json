Student organizations play a significant role in providing effective learning environments for students, preparing members to live and work in a global community and develop affinity for the campus.  In addition to building lasting friendships and relationships, student organizations provide many benefits including serving as a forum for academic discourse, personal growth and development, leadership development, intercultural understanding and community engagement often for a lifetime. Involved students tend to perform better academically and are more likely to graduate when compared with their non-involved peers.
