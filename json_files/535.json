Broadly speaking, I am interested in most\naspects of data center networking.  I am especially interested in the\nintersection of network systems, operating systems, and computer\narchitecture.  In addition to my interests in computer science, I enjoy participating\nin many hobbies, including music, kaizo Mario, biking, boarding, and\nbrewing.  I enjoy many types of biking, from commuting on a road bike to\nriding dirt jumps on a BMX.    Interests   Networking  Operating Systems  Data Center Applications     Education      Postdoctoral Researcher, 2015-2018  UW-Madison       PhD, Computer Science, 2015  Rice University       MS, Computer Science, 2012  Rice University       BS, Electrical Engineering, 2009  Rice University               Recent Highlights     NSF CAREER: NIC-Accelerated Active Messaging as a Generic Replacement and Awards for RDMA NSF 2020  This proposal aims to fundamentally rethink the\ndesign of server-side networking and develop new networking\nabstractions for Network Interface Card (NIC) accelerated messaging.     NSF CRII: NeTS: Rethinking Flow Control for Cloud Data Center Networks NSF 2019  This proposal makes the case for fundamentally\nrethinking how queuing and flow control are performed in both physical\nand virtual switches.     Google Faculty Research Award Google 2018              Research Interests  I am looking for motivated and passionate students.  If you are\ninterested in working with me, please feel free to reach out and start a\nconversation with me.  My interests in computer science are broad, and I\nam willing to entertain any compelling projects.  However, I am\ncurrently particularly interested in the following research areas:    Designing new switch programs that fundamentally rethink flow control,\ne.g., how switch should drop packets, and how switches should avoid\ndropping packets.    New architectures for reconfigurable match table (RMT) switches and\nNICs.    Explicitly co-scheduling network and CPU resources so as to maximize\nhigh-level application and infrastructure objectives.    Integrating programmable NICs and switches into the OS and network\ncore by developing new protocols and offloads that treat the servers\nand network in a cluster as a single heterogeneous processor.    New abstractions and frameworks for developing microservices and\nfunction chains.            Selected Publications       Brent Stephens , Aditya Akella , Michael M.
