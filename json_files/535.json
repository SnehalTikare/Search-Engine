I-Share will quickly deliver physical items from Illinois academic libraries. Interlibrary Loan (ILLiad) will allow you to request scanned articles and items not available in I-Share.       Log in to I-Share  Log in to ILLiad  If you have trouble logging in, you can set up a Library account .   How to request books and media in I-Share   Search I-Share for an item  Click on what you need!  Click “Request from I-Share Libraries” button  Log in, or create account   Register once by linking your UIC “Library ID Number” with your record.  You only need your NetID and password to order items.

You’ll get an email when the item is ready to pick up, usually in 3-5 business days.  How to request scanned articles and items from libraries worldwide in ILLiad   Login to ILLiad  Once you are logged into ILLiad click Find it @ UIC in library databases or in Google Scholar to pre-fill the request form for articles.

In Google Scholar, the link is sometimes hidden under the >> symbol.  You’ll get an email when the item is ready to pick up or posted electronically (usually 1-10 business days).  Most requests for physical items (books, DVDs, microfilm, etc.) are filled within 5-10 business days.  Most article requests are filled within 1-4 business days.
