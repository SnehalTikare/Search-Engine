Established in 2000, CEPAC draws its membership from both professional practitioners—many of whom are UIC alumni—and civil engineering faculty members. Its ranks include leaders in the environmental, geotechnical, structures, transportation, and water resources fields and represent private companies and government agencies throughout the Chicago region.
