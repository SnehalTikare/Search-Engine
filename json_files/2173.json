This status is appropriate for aliens coming to engage in  commercial  transactions such as participation in scientific,  educational,  professional, or business conventions or conferences, or  to perform  independent research.  Enables citizens of participating countries to travel to the  United  States for business (WB) or tourism (WT) for 90 days or less  without  obtaining a U.S. visa.    Participating Countries   Participating Countries    Andorra  Hungary  New Zealand    Australia  Iceland  Norway    Austria  Ireland  Portugal    Belgium  Italy  San Marino    Brunei  Japan  Singapore    Czech Republic  Latvia  Slovakia    Denmark  Liechtenstein  Slovenia    Estonia  Lithuania  South Korea    Finland  Luxembourg  Spain    France  Malta  Sweden    Germany  Monaco  Switzerland    Greece  the Netherlands  United Kingdom**     **Refers only to British citizens who have the unrestricted   right of permanent abode in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland,   Wales, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man); it   does not include British overseas citizens, British dependent   territories, or citizens of British Commonwealth countries.   Immigration Requirements  WB Visitors may be admitted for a maximum of 90 days with no possibility to extend their stay or change status within the U.S.  If a longer stay is anticipated, please see the information page on B-1 status or call OIS for further information.   Passports:     All VWP entrants must comply with machine-readability and biometrics requirements.  If there are questions about whether a passport is machine  readable,  contact the passport issuing authority in your country of  citizenship.  Requirements are subject to change based on Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations.     ESTA verification system:   ESTA (Electronic System for Travel Authorization) is an  electronic  authorization system that must be completed at least 72  hours before  travel as a WB/WT visitor to the U.S.  Visit the ESTA website for additional information and to complete an on-line application.  A response of “Travel Not Authorized” means that one cannot  enter  the U.S. under the VWP program. To enter as a visitor, he or she  would  then have to apply for a B-1 visa at a U.S. consulate.  ESTA authorization is valid for up to two years unless  revoked, or  if there is a change in the individuals’ name, gender,  country of  citizenship, or a new passport is issued.  ESTA authorization only confirms that one is eligible to apply for entry to the U.S. it is not a guarantee of admission, such decisions are made by USCBP at the Port of Entry.      Port-of-Entry Procedures: Beginning summer  2010,  travelers in the ESTA system will no longer be issued a paper   arrival/departure form (Form I-94W).  This new process will be phased-in   at various airports during the summer of 2010.   For additional information about the VWP, please see the U.S. Department of State site and the USCIS site .   Payments and Limitations at UIC   WB Visitors may be reimbursed for expenses.  Payment may be for   academic activities that last no longer than 9 days and provided that   the visitor does not receive payments from more than 5 institutions   within six months.  Please see the Office of Payroll Services for the “Tax Reporting and Withholding Checklist for Foreign National   Reimbursements.”  Completion of this compliance statement will be   necessary before Payroll will allow payment to the individual.  WB visitors can act as consultants for up to 9 days but cannot   legally accept teaching or research positions or other employment for   which they are paid by a U.S. institution.  Payroll sets the standard for reimbursements so please consult   Payroll for information about limitations on reimbursement for airfare,   insurance and per diem.    Procedure to invite a WB Visitor  Before inviting an international visitor, the department must verify   that all requirements have been met for the WB visa category.  In order   to facilitate this process, the department should: 1) review the WB Visa Checklist ,   which is available for download on the OIS website; and 2) consult  with  OIS to ensure all necessary documentation is collected and/or  drafted.  Departmental Requirements :   The international visitor is limited to a temporary stay of 90 days or less without extension.  The purpose of the visit is solely for temporary commercial,   business, or professional activities, such as attendance at conventions   or conferences, or for professional consultation and observation of a   specific and defined nature.  The purpose of the visit should be   documented in a WB Invitation Letter (see WB Visa Checklist for a template).  The international visitor cannot be paid by the department or  UIC,  but may be reimbursed for nominal costs related to travel expenses   and/or accommodations.  Honoraria payments may be considered if the   visit to UIC is not longer than nine days, and the visitor has not   accepted honoraria from more than five institutions or organizations   within a six-month period.  The international visitor may not be given a formal academic appointment at UIC.  The international visitor may not have any direct or indirect patient contact, or interact with research subjects in any manner.  The international visitor may not attempt to obtain employment   within the U.S., or attempt to change their status to J-1 or H-1B.  The international may not volunteer or take part in departmental operation decisions, or be given an appointment at UIC.  The international visitor may not conduct research using   departmental equipment or resources unless there is direct supervision   by the sponsor.  The international visitor may not displace U.S. workers in any way.   International Visitor Requirements :   The international visitor must have an institutional affiliation in his/her home country or country of permanent residence.  The international must have adequate finances and health  insurance  to support himself/herself for their duration of stay in the  U.S.  The international visitor must abide by the intent of his/her visit throughout their stay in the U.S.   After arrival, and if the visit is for one  week or more,  please contact OIS to arrange a “virtual” or in-person  check-in.   Please send an email to ois@uic.edu or call 996-3121.    xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?
