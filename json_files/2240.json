The UIC SAFE App is a one-stop security shop designed to assist students during a commute, when working alone, in cases of needing emergency help, and more. The purpose of the UIC SAFE App is to help build a culture of preparedness at UIC by using simple navigations.  The app consists of 7 key features:   Panic Button: Quickly activate and call for help from your location.  Report Light Outage: Notify facilities management of street light outages or area lights that aren’t working.  Emergency Guides: Know who to call and what to do in an emergency.  Report a Tip: Share tips or other information with authorities that will help solve crimes and create a safer community.  Chat with UIC Police: Ask questions and get answers in real-time.  Safe Commute: Learn about your options for a safer walk or ride.  Work Alone: Let someone know where and when you’re working alone.   By utilizing the app, students can take safety precautions on campus while commuting from building to building. In order to maximize the efficiency of the app, make sure to complete your UIC safe profile, enable location services, and take advantage of the virtual buddy system. Please consider downloading the app and sharing the resource with your friends and classmates!

Always avoid walking alone. Try to travel in groups, when possible.  Look for the location of the nearest emergency call box (there are more than 2,000 across campus).  Become familiar with university confines and the neighborhood and know how to navigate it safely.  Walk on well-lit sidewalks and pathways.  Do NOT use headphones or earbuds while walking; music can be a distraction from hearing an individual or a group approaching from behind.  Stay sober. Those who are under the influence of drugs and alcohol can be more vulnerable to would-be thieves or predators.  Whether you live on- or off-campus, it is important to remember to lock doors and windows when you are away.  Always have a charged cell phone and emergency cash.  Always have emergency contacts on you or in your mobile device.  Remember — A crime-free campus requires that everyone report suspicious activity by calling the UIC Police and report conditions that make crime possible.      Safety Tips when coming to, or from, classes:    Whether you’re parking on the street or in a city parking lot, be sure to lock your car.  Keep all valuables out of sight.  Always be aware of your surroundings. Self-awareness is crucial!  Try to use “the buddy system” when exiting the building, particularly after dark.  When walking to your vehicle, have your keys ready in hand.  Notify friends or family of your whereabouts and plans.  If you notice anything suspicious or potentially dangerous, please inform a staff member immediately. If you are in the parking lot area and in need of emergency assistance, call 911.
