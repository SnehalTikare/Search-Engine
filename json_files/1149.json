A special interest group centered on anything and everything security in the field of computer science. We try to focus on what you do not necessarily learn from class and hosting/entering various capture the flag (CTF) tournaments. What to expect?  Interactive labs and demos, informative lectures and guest speakers! Visit the github repo to see what we've covered so far. When do we meet? Tuesdays at 5:00-6:00p.m. Join our mailing list for the location for the week (we tend to bounce between the ACM Office, WiCS Lounge and CS Lounge).
