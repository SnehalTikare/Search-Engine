If you eat well, exercise regularly and maintain a recommended weight, are you healthy? If your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar are within normal limits, are you healthy?  Now, what if you tear a ligament? Develop arthritis? Begin to lose your hearing? What if you develop adult-onset asthma? Get a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis? Suffer a paralyzing injury? Are you still healthy?  We’re here to demonstrate that there’s no reason you can’t be.  At the UIC College of Applied Health Sciences, we define health as more than the absence of illness, disease or disability. We believe people can enjoy health participation in life, whatever their circumstances. And we’re working every day to prove just that.  AHS is multidisciplinary community of health science educators, researchers, scholars and advocates who contribute to the health and well-being of people, particularly those living in urban environments.
