Students at UIC are automatically enrolled in Campus Care ,   a package of supplemental health benefits designed to provide care for   accidents and illnesses. Campus Care covers health services not   provided under the Health Service Fee. Dental, Vision and Hearing care   are not included in Campus Care, however they do provide packages for   these services at discounted prices.  All students are charged for Medical Insurance, and a mandatory   Health Service Fee will be assessed to your account. You will see this   fee on your tuition bill. For questions regarding this fee, please   contact Campus Care.  Waivers : It may be possible to waive enrollment in Campus Care. Please see review the Waiver material on the Campus Care website.   Medical Insurance for Students after Graduation   Campus Care coverage may extend through the summer after graduation.  University of Illinois Alumni Alliance also may offer insurance options after graduation.   Medical Insurance Policy Requirements for J-1 Students  In addition to Campus Care, J-1 Exchange Visitors (students) and   their J-2 dependents must have health insurance that meets the minimum   requirements as defined by the U.S. Department of State, at all times   during the J program. Most J-1 students will need to purchase   supplemental insurance to include medical evacuation and repatriation. Please see the J-1 insurance section of our website for additional information. Proof of insurance will   need to be provided to OIS upon Check-in and with any request made at   the OIS, if valid insurance with OIS is not on file for J-1 and all J-2   dependents. To update health insurance, fill out a J-1 Health Insurance Compliance Form and attach copies of valid health insurance documents for all J-1 and J-2s.   EXCHANGE VISITOR INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS  The U.S. Department of State requires medical insurance for all J-1   Exchange Visitors and their dependents. To maintain lawful status, J-1   visitors and their J-2 dependents must have health insurance that meets   the minimum requirements as defined by the U.S. Department of State  Note for students and those scholars paid by UIC : If you are eligible, or become eligible, for UIC health insurance, please be aware that UIC insurance plans do not include medical evacuation and repatriation for a foreign national   being flown from the United States to his/her country. Therefore,   supplemental insurance, to include medical evacuation and repatriation   for the J-1 and his/her dependents, will need to be purchased in order   to maintain lawful status.     Please note: Detailed insurance information will be sent with exchange visitor welcome and admissions packets.      xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-16\"?
