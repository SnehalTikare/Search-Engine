The DRC team has moved to a remote working policy based on the most recent guidelines for COVID-19.   We ask faculty to work with their students who have existing Letters of Accommodation (LOA), and/or implementation of accommodations to discuss an alternative way to provide axillary aid and services. We are here to provide support and guidance during this emergency health concern for both students and faculty. Our goal is to transition this support by offering consultation with our disability specialists and providing alternative accessibility for testing and course materials. We have a link on the DRC website to assist faculty to prepare for digital instruction with online classes.  Remote Sign Language Interpreter and CART requests can be submitted through our Online Form ; a member of the DRC team will follow up to ensure timely fulfillment of your request.  Questions or concerns regarding alternative accommodated testing can be fielded by our Testing Coordinators, who can be reached at accesstesting@uic.edu .  Questions or concerns regarding alternative format materials for courses may be fielded by our document conversion team, who can be reached at accesstext@uic.edu .  Questions from students, faculty, and staff regarding referrals, existing Letters of Accommodation, and/or implementation of accommodations, may be directed to our Disability Specialists. Please contact the Specialist listed at the top of the student’s LOA, or contact our front desk at (312) 413-2183 or our general email address, drc@uic.edu to be directed to the appropriate Specialist.  The DRC team will continue to respond to emails and advise you by email, phone or using Webex/Zoom.
