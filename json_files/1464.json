There is no software to download. The audience responds on the Web using any device or via SMS texting on a phone.  UPDATE: ACCC sponsored trial of Poll Everywhere concludes on May 30th, 2020.  In 2014, the Personal Computing Device Committee of the ITGC recommended adopting a single Student Response System (SRS) for all colleges in the university. This prompted ACCC to purchase a trial license to Poll Everywhere  develop support resources, and conduct pilot research for faculty adoption of this new tool.  After careful consideration regarding the cost of moving to an enterprise license, adoption rate, feedback from faculty and instructional designers, and the availability of polling as part of Echo360, another ACCC supported system, the ACCC-LTS team determined that the Poll Everywhere trial should end.  The Poll Everywhere trial license will be active until May 30th, 2020. At that time, all instructor accounts and corresponding polls will continue to be available using the features of the free version. The enterprise features of the ACCC supported version will no longer function.  If you are interested in polling or are currently using PollEverywhere, Contact LTS@uic.edu to schedule a meeting to discuss your options or a transition plan.
