This annual interdisciplinary exhibit competition is organized by the UIC Graduate College and the University Library to showcase the breadth  and diversity of research at UIC. Each year, students enrolled in a graduate or professional degree program are invited to submit an image they created along with a précis of how the  image relates to the student’s overall research. From Soorin's submission on her design explorations of epoxy resin: …from the start of my experimentation, I was very much interested in the concept of “capturing moments”. How can we capture meaningful memories? The fact that resin was solidifying the liquid aspects of the ink was one of my serendipitous and coincidental moments. It was also very interesting to see the unusual reaction of ink and resin. Using the disk molds allowed the resin and ink to achieve more depth and layers. The effects also looked similar to a bacteria, sea moss or cells as if I was looking into a microscope or even a kaleidoscope. Looking into its own little resin world was fascinating.
