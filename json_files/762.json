The multiple areas that influence health comprise our work: health behaviors; social determinants of health, including social and economic factors; clinical care; the physical environment; and health-related practices and policies.  “Education, employment, income, family and social support, community safety — all are highly relevant to health outcomes. I invite UIC researchers studying any of these influences to join us.”  — ROBIN MERMELSTEIN, PhD, DIRECTOR         Presentations        Meta-Analysis and the Early Career Researcher     Methods for Investigating Heterogeneity in Intervention Effects: Beyond Traditional Tests of Moderation      more           Announcements        Notice of Filing - LCA      more      News        Cook County’s Short-Lived ‘Soda’ Tax Worked, Says New Study    A study of beverage sales in Cook County, Illinois, shows that for four months in 2017 — when the county implemented a penny-per-ounce tax on both sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks — purchases of the taxed beverages decreased by 21%, even after an adjustment for cross-border shopping.
