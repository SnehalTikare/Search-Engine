Click on the appropriate link on the left for general information about waivers, assistantships and fellowships available to UIC students.       Waivers     BOT or Graduate College Tuition Waivers         BOT   Board of Trustees (BOT) Waivers are awarded by the Graduate College and individual graduate programs. The SFAS disburses the waivers but does not determine recipients. A student must be enrolled in a degree-seeking program at least 12 or more hours during the fall and spring semesters (6 or more during summer) at the end of the add/drop period for the waiver to pay. BOT waiver recipients must NOT have eligibility for a waiver from any other source (for example, an assistantship waiver) in order to remain eligible. If a student receives a waiver, his/her loan eligibility may be affected. For more information about Board of Trustees or Graduate College waivers, please see the Graduate College website .  Students must report wavers to the SFAS upon receiving their electronic financial aid notification.        Child of Employee Tuition Waiver         COETW   The Child of Employee 50% Tuition Waiver (CETW) is available for undergraduate children of Illinois senior public university employees at participant schools. Fees and charges other than tuition are not included in this waiver. For detailed information about the policy, eligibility and application for the CETW waiver, please visit the Human Resource website .        Children of Veterans Tuition Waiver         COVTW   The Children of Veterans Tuition Waiver is awarded for four consecutive years at the University of Illinois to natural or legally adopted children of service members who are veterans of World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam Conflict, the Southwest Asia Conflict, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.  The following are limitations to the Children of Veterans Tuition Waiver:   One tuition waiver will be given per county, per war.  Candidates must be permanent residents of the Illinois County from which they apply.  Students must submit copies of ACT/SAT scores each year they apply, as prior year applications are not reviewed.  Students must complete the application by March 1 for the upcoming academic year.   Applications are available each December 1 st and notifications are released by April 1 st . All applications for the three University of Illinois campuses are reviewed in Urbana-Champaign and must be submitted accordingly.

Assistantships         TA/RA/GA TW   Students with assistantship appointments may qualify to have tuition and some fees waived. To be eligible, the assistantship must be between 25%-67% and cover at least 91 continuous days of the fall or spring semesters (41 days for summer appointments).
