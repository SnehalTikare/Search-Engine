The Graduate College may decide to uphold our recommendation or deny the application.

Admission can be deferred once for up to one academic year (for example, Fall admission can be deferred to the following Fall term). Notify us as soon as possible that you’d like to defer admission. If your deferral is approved, we’ll forward it to campus for final approval and official updates to the student record.   If you've been denied...  You may contact us directly to inquire about our decision. In some cases, we can advise you on what you can do to improve your applicant profile or successfully apply for a future term.
