Kenyon 2  Armstrong Laboratory, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 1 ;\r\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago 2 .  Purpose  Far objects\r\nappear blurred when viewed through a screen mesh (Mandelbaum effect) presumably\r\nbecause accommodation is biased towards the near screen. Owens reported\r\nthis bias is maximum when the screen is near the dark focus point. We studied\r\ndynamic accommodation while a far target is viewed and an intervening screen\r\nis added.  Methods  The Mandelbaum\r\neffect was demonstrated to five untrained emmetropic subjects (age = 22\r\n± 2). Then, eye focus was continuously measured (40Hz) with an infrared\r\noptometer as subjects monocularly viewed a 20/70 Snellen E on a eye chart\r\nlocated 26 feet away. Each 30-second trial had four consecutive viewing\r\nconditions: (1) look at E directly (baseline), (2) look at E through screen,\r\n(3) look at screen, and (4) look at E through screen again. In separate\r\ntrials, the screen was at the distance of maximum blur (124 cm ±\r\n13), or 40 cm. Dark focus was also measured.  Results (1) Eye focus\r\ndid not change from baseline with screen addition. (2) Eye focus\r\nwas near veridical when attention was directed to the screen. (3) Eye focus returned to baseline when attention was redirected to the far\r\nE. All subjects reported blur of the far E while viewing through the screen.\r\nThe screen distance of maximum blur was not predicted by dark focus.  Conclusion  This objective\r\nexperiment, along with some subjective observations, indicate the Mandelbaum\r\neffect is not likely due to involuntary mis-accommodation.  Owens, D.A. (1979). J. Opt.
