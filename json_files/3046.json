Effective, humane, respectful and compassionate communication with and care for patients, teachers and fellow students is an essential component of the academic expectations and standards of the UIC medical school program. In addition, those responsible for educating medical students are expected to emphasize the importance of professionalism and demonstrate it by example. The University of Illinois College of Medicine is committed to providing and maintaining a safe and effective learning environment in which students, residents, fellows, faculty, and healthcare and administrative staff work together to both educate and learn in a manner that promotes the highest level of patient care. As an institution that trains the physician leaders of tomorrow, we expect members of our community to uphold an academic environment that encourages mutually respectful relationships, is conducive to learning, and is free of mistreatment, unlawful discrimination and harassment, and threats of retaliation. All members of the medical education community have a shared responsibility to protect the integrity of the learning environment, a right to work and learn free of unlawful discrimination, harassment and mistreatment, and to report any incident in which that positive learning environment has been compromised. The UI COM expects that students and teachers alike will adhere to the applicable college, campus and university-wide policies, procedures, and guidelines that establish standards for professionalism and conduct, as well as those principles of professionalism and ethics generally accepted within the medical profession, including, but not limited to the following: The UI COM Statement on Professional Behavior The Standards of Conduct contained in the UIC Student Disciplinary Policy The UI COM Positive Learning Environment Policy Reporting Medical Student Mistreatment & Learning Environment Concerns The University of Illinois at Chicago Discrimination and Harassment Policies The University of Illinois Nondiscrimination Statement The University of Illinois at Chicago Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct The University of Illinois Statement on Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct University of Illinois Code of Conduct AAMC Statement on the Learning Environment The principles set forth in Medical Professionalism in the New Millenium: A Physician Charter Education MD Admissions Requirements and Timeline Application Process Tuition and Financial Aid Campus Selection Curricular Programs Interview Day Student Life FAQs Contact MD Curriculum and Academics Physician Competency Reference Curricular Programs Assessment and Evaluation Scholarly and Research Opportunities Visiting Student Information DME Resources MD Student Services and Support Student Affairs Student Experience Blueprint Specialty Webinars Specialty Resource Directory MSPE MSPE Quartile in Class Calculation (2021 Graduates and forward) MSPE Quartile in Class Calculation (2019 and 2020 Graduates) Registrar Student Financial Aid and Debt Management Student Honors and Awards MD Student Life Diversity Ceremonies and Events University Medical Student Council (USMC) Educational Environment Director of Medical Student Learning Environment Reporting Mistreatment or Concerns College Policy & Guidelines Positive Learning Environment Policy Teacher & Student Guidelines Examples of Negative Behaviors DMSLE Notes Educational Affairs Curricular Innovations National Initiatives Publications and Presentations Accreditation (LCME) The Department of Medical Education (DME) Educational Policies Faculty Development Instructional Design and Support Instructional Methods and Strategies International Education Masters and Doctorate Programs Graduate Medical Education (GME) UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS College of Medicine UIC’s seven health sciences colleges and health care delivery enterprise.
