For information on all of them, visit our college-wide student organizations page .       orgs   ­       Association for Computing Machinery  Linux Users Group  LOGiCA  Women in Computer Science         Association for Computing Machinery      UIC’s student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) brings together students who want to understand and contribute to the computing technology around them. This group serves as a bridge between the CS department and students, providing tutoring and assistance to everyone taking CS courses. Events include LAN parties, lectures by guest speakers, and the ICPC programming competition. ACM also supports student-led Special Interest Groups (SIGs), which give students opportunities to learn about and work with technologies including AI, blockchain, game development, systems administration, and DevOps.  Find the ACM online here .           Linux Users Group      The Linux Users Group is a community for students who are interested in all aspects of Linux. It focuses on providing the support and education that students need, and it organizes regular events and activities around spreading the use of Linux and open-source software.   Visit LUG’s website here .           LOGiCA      The mission of LOGiCA is to increase the participation and success of students from Latinx and underrepresented communities pursuing careers in the field of computing and computer science. We are a network of students working together to develop technical, leadership, and professional skills through an environment that encourages camaraderie and growth not only as individuals, but also as a community. We are an organization dedicated to inclusivity and welcome all who share our vision.  Visit the LOGiCA website here and join our e-mailing list here .           Women in Computer Science      Women in Computer Science of the University of Illinois at Chicago (WiCS) is a student organization within the computer science department that aims to support and promote women and other marginalized genders in computer science. WiCS provides a support network of role models, mentors, and peers and acts as a social, technical, and networking community for all interested parties at UIC.  WiCS strives to promote an increased knowledge of and greater interest in the contributions of women in the science, design, development, construction, languages, management, and applications of modern computing.
