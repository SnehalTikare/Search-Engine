These minors require between 12 and 18 semester hours, along with some prerequisite courses.  These minors are a great choice for students pursuing other engineering disciplines who wish to develop and demonstrate expertise in either mechanical or industrial engineering. They also are open to students in UIC’s other undergraduate colleges—the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Business—who want to add engineering coursework to their degrees.  Follow the links below for the course catalog pages on each minor. If you are thinking about pursuing a minor, contact your academic advisor to ensure that you meet the requirements and to coordinate these courses in your schedule.      links to MIE minors           Mechanical engineering minor             Industrial engineering minor              Undergraduate           Admitted Students    Admissions    Accreditation    Courses    ME Major    IE Major    EM Major    Minors    Internships and Jobs    Student Groups    Student Profiles    Student Resources                    ",
