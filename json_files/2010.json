Submission can be done by logging into your application summary page and following the instructions for uploading documents. As part of your OIS Documents, international students must submit detailed financial statements before a Form I-20/DS-2019 can be processed. These statements should include the amounts and sources of funds available for educational expenses in the United States.  NOTE: Students are not required to submit the OIS Documents until they have been admitted to UIC. However, submission prior to admission will help expedite the processing of the I-20 or DS-2019 and students are welcome to do so at any time after submitting their application.  For the most up-to-date information regarding your admission, please check your Undergraduate or Graduate application status online.  Submitting the OIS Documents for your Initial I-20 or DS-2019  All international students who will be sponsored by the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), including those students who will transfer their immigration record to UIC, must submit a completed UIC Declaration and Certification of Finances (DCF), financial documentation, and a copy of the biographical page in your passport in order for you to obtain the I-20 or DS-2019 necessary to obtain your student visa. These documents are collectively known as “OIS Documents” on your application checklist. To fulfill your \"OIS Documents\" requirement, please submit the documents by logging into your Undergraduate or Graduate Application Summary Page :   Declaration and Certification of Finances (DCF)   Complete this document in full, including your signature and the names and signatures of your financial sponsors (if any).  The UIC Declaration and Certification of Finances (DCF) is a required document and cannot be substituted by other affidavits of support.    Evidence of Funding  Submit a financial statement (or combination of statements) showing a total balance equal to or greater than the estimated expenses for your first year of study at UIC.    Copy of passport  Photocopy your passport's biographical page showing your name and personal information.     Which account types are acceptable for the I-20/DS-2019 request?  Financial statements must be signed or stamped by a bank official, and show a current balance. Students may be contacted to submit additional proof of authentication, if needed. Statements should not be issued more than six months from the date of request. Documents must be in English, or include a certified English translation.  The following is a summary of acceptable sources of funding:   Certificates of Deposit, Fixed Deposits, Fixed Term Certificate of Deposits, Time Deposits and Term Deposits.  Checking Accounts.  Education Loans: it must be evident that the person is pre-approved or approved for the loan.  Bonds: the maturity date or value date must be clearly listed and be before the first day of the semester.  Provident Funds: the amount available for withdrawal must be stated in the letter.

Scholarship Award Letters: an official letter from the sponsoring agency must clearly state the terms of the scholarship, such as tuition, fees, and books and living expenses provided. If the scholarship includes a stipend, it must state the dollar amount per month.  University Funding: students admitted to programs that provide University funding in the form of assistantships, fellowships, tuition waivers or other forms of scholarship may wish to delay submission until an official letter of appointment or offer has been issued by the academic department. If the funding provided by your academic department does not cover the total expense listed in the estimated expenses , you will need to submit evidence of personal funds to cover the difference between your award and the full amount required. If funding from your academic department is not guaranteed, and you intend to attend the University even without funding, it may be best to submit the documents as soon as possible to avoid delays with obtaining your visa. This will not affect any funding decisions from your academic program.

How do I defer my admission to a later semester?
