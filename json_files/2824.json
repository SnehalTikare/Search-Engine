With the advent of the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act going into effect on January 1, 2020, it is important to know that the legalization of marijuana and its related practices do not change UIC’s alcohol and other drug policies.  As a reminder, under the federal Controlled Substances Act, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance and is illegal. Consistent with that Act and the federal Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and the Drug-Free Workplace Act, the University prohibits the unlawful or unauthorized possession, use, distribution, dispensation, sale, or manufacture of marijuana on University property or as part of any University activity. The passage of the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act in 2019, which legalizes certain activities related to marijuana under Illinois state law effective January 1, 2020, does not affect federal law or the university’s marijuana prohibition.  In addition, the University’s marijuana prohibition applies to both recreational and medical use. That means having a medical marijuana registry identification card under the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act does not allow you to use or possess marijuana on University property (this includes but is not limited to outdoor spaces, classrooms, and residential halls) or as part of any University activity.  Compliance with these laws and acts represents the University commitment to maintaining a healthy learning and work environment. In addition, remaining in compliance helps to protect the millions of dollars in federal funding UIC receives for student financial aid and research.
