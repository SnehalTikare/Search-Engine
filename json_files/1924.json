Visiting Special Collections and University Archives  If you would like to use special collections, rare books, manuscripts, maps or the University Archives, make an appointment for your visit in advance .

The UIC John Marshall Law School Library primarily serves the faculty and students of JMLS and is administered separately from the UIC University Library.
