Come prepared with multiple course options.  New students are not allowed to register for non-CS courses or for CS 597 / CS 598  hours during their first semester.  Computer science has a strict registration policy. Review it here .  Degree requirements will be discussed in detail at the mandatory CS graduate student orientation.   *PhD students should consult their assigned advisor for guidance.        Holds         Learn about registration holds   As a new student, you may have several holds on your account, some of which may prevent you from registering.
