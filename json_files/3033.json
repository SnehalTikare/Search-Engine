I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science, and Director of Intelligent Systems Security Lab in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Dayton . My research leverages programming language and compiler techniques to enforce security policies to defend against cyber attacks in the areas of JavaScript/Web applications, mobile systems, vehicle systems, and Internet of Things frameworks.  I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Chalmers University of Technology , Sweden in 2011. I received my Master's degree from University of Ulsan , South Korea in 2006, and Bachelor's degree from HCMUT , Vietnam in 2001.     My profile on →    My profile on UD →      Research My research mainly focuses on software security, with use of ideas from programming languages, reference monitors, and compilers to defeat potential malicious behaviors from untrusted software.
