Since 2012, the entire campus has been engaged in a collective effort to explore ways that will enhance our students’ success. Every unit on campus has been involved as we have developed, nurtured, and maintained student success programs, conducted research related to student success, and sought collaborations with a variety of external partners, including community-based organizations, Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago, and many others.
