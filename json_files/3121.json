The older programs focused on skills training, production experience, and preparation for entry-level practical work. In the past decade, the communication discipline has changed. The arrival of the internet has blurred the separation of personal (speech) communication from public (journalism) communication where online, the media fuses with interpersonal activities. Leading universities have merged speech and media into one department. Instead of focusing on production and entry-level jobs, the new departments train students for a lifetime of career changes.  The Department of Communication provides undergraduate students with a broad liberal education that covers communication from the personal through the international levels and builds responsible citizenship. Students gain depth in understanding communication processes in a diverse metropolitan setting. The Department approach is conceptual, helping students build critical thinking and research skills to face challenges from the multiple careers they will pursue.

Within the communication discipline, the Department specializes in areas where speech and media converge:   New technology  Intercultural diversity (including race, ethnicity, and gender/sexuality)  Politics and rhetoric  Cultural and visual studies   The Bachelor of Arts in Communication program has six core courses:   An introduction to the discipline and the faculty  A survey of human (speech) communication  A survey of public (media) communication  A course on technology introduces a main focus in the Department  Two courses on communication analysis cover statistics and teach students how to write communication research   Courses at the 300 and 400 levels fulfill selective requirements for seven courses in analysis and research, with topics ranging across the discipline. A senior seminar provides a capstone experience in the final year.  Students enrich their experience and build their own interests that match the faculty specialties. For example, a student with interests in diversity can gain intercultural experience through participating in study abroad, which is strongly encouraged, and through minoring in related areas, such as Gender & Womenâ€™s Studies . A student with interests in visual communication can minor in Art History .  Students desiring hands-on experience for entry level jobs in communication industries arrange for at least one internship and participate in student activities that build a network of contacts with alumni and professionals.      nav           Advising & Registration             Apply Now              Academics           Undergraduate Studies     Admissions     Major Requirements    Minor Requirements    Financial Aid      Advising & Registration     Internships and Independent Studies    Program Completion      Life After UIC     Building a Resume    Careers    Graduate School    Alumni Networks    Course Descriptions     UIC Class Schedule          Graduate Studies     Prospective Students     Application Requirement and Process    Graduate Appointment Application    Assistantships, Fellowships, or Tuition waivers    Other Funding Opportunities    Graduate FAQ     General Questions    Application and Admission Questions    Admission Exams and Language Proficiency Questions    Financial Assistance Questions    Illinois Residency Questions        Current Students     MA Program     MA Coursework    Thesis    Non-Thesis Option    MA Graduate Forms      PhD Program     PhD Coursework    PhD Roadmap     Advisement    Program Proposal    PhD Coursework    Funding and Support    IRB Training    Preliminary Exam    Dissertation    Completion      PhD Forms          Courses and Course Requirements    Award Application Info                    ",
