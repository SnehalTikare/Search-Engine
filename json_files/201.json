Student Access   Each new student is assigned a CS account that expires one year after graduation. Your login may be checked at http://go.uic.edu/csaccount , and passwords are initially set to the student’s UIN. We highly encourage users to change their passwords after their initial login.  Students are given a space quota of 1 GB and print quota of 600 pages per semester.  Accounts can be accessed by logging on to the lab workstations or remote servers, allowing students the flexibility to complete their course work from the lab, home or work.
