My research interests go from visual-system related problems that can be robustly solved through automation, to problems that require human experts in the computational loop, and the principles behind this work. [ CV ]  This body of research has been recognized by my peers with an NSF CAREER Award and by multiple NSF and multi-site NIH R01 awards , including one as an early-stage investigator. I have received multiple Oustanding Research Awards at conferences, along with my students. My research has been featured on journal and newsletter covers. I have co-authored scientific open-source software adopted by thousands of users, and I am a patent co-author.  I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science and a faculty member of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The lab's research pages are the best place to learn more about my current work. Prior to UIC, I was Research Faculty in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University and the founder and director of the Interdisciplinary Visualization Research Lab in the Rust Belt; the lab's research pages are the best place to learn more about my past work, my group, our projects, results, publications, courses taught, alumni and sponsors.  Teaching:  I have received six Teaching Awards for courses that blend teaching and research; although, or perhaps because, I often choose to experiment with my teaching and learn from the results. My lab's teaching portfolio showcases some of the work produced by my students.     Education   Ph.D., Brown University, 2007                      ",
