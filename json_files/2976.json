Not true in many real-world environments. Open-world learning : Identify instances of unseen classes during testing or application and incrementally learn the new classes.   Continuous Knowledge Learning in Dialogues   To enable a dialgoue system (chatbot) to learn new knowledge continuously during conversations (after deployment), i.e., learning on the job .

Generate a Book Automatically using Web Content : Synthesize knowledge on the Web (See our WWW-2003 paper ).  Given a topic, discover sub-topics and related concepts, and \nsynthesize information from multiple Web pages to present a coherent and \nfairly complete picture of the topic.

Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery     Diagnostic Data Mining - Interestingness of Knowledge : Finding interesting and actionable knowledge.  We built a system in 2006, called Opportunity Map (also known as OM in Motorola). It was deployed in 2006 and is still\nin regular use in Motorola. Motorola has sold copies of the system to some Telco companies. There is also a patent, but unfortunately it is owned by Motorola, not us :-(.
