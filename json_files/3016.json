This research includes characterizing the shifting long-term\nprivacy needs of Internet users, better understanding the extent to which deep\nlearning threatens user security and privacy on the web, as well as the\npractical impact of security-centric tools like Single Sign-On and VPNs for\nusers and non-users alike.  I am very interested in new collaborations, motivated students, and lively\nconversation regarding security research - please reach out via email or\ntwitter if you’d like to chat!
