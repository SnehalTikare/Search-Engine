This architecture will make use of dynamically evolving data\nsuch as measurement streams collected by sensors, or Web services that execute requests on behalf of transactions.\nData integration tools and ontologies will be developed and then applied to actual source data, to user profiles,\nand to the diverse problems of matching users with data sources and relevant courses of action. This activity will\nbe augmented by the use of data mining techniques for dynamically constructing spatio-temporal user profiles and\nfor profile classification. Methodologies will be developed to ensure scalability of the system. For example, the\nuse of data cubes for caching user profiles and retrieved data, and the use of request aggregation. An authentication\nmodel will be developed using a distributed trust framework that will be applied to spatio-temporal context and\ndata streams. The architecture will also incorporate a component for services arbitration that can manage on-demand\nresource allocation in a competitive environment. A system prototype will be tested against the operational scenario\nof a public health management application, provided by the Alliance of Chicago Community Health Services.  The architecture of the proposed system is shown in the following figure:      The material on this web site is based upon work supported\nby the National Science Foundation under Grants ITR IIS-0326284 (to UIC), ITR IIS-0324846 (to Brown), and ITR IIS-0325144\n(to Northwestern).
