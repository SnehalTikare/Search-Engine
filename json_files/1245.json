Everyone is a critic. At the end of the day, it’s your resume, so you get to decide how to market yourself.  Be consistent with styles (font type, bold-type, italics, usage of periods, underlines, etc.).  A job/project/internship description should have at least 2-3 bullet points.  Action verbs must be in the past tense if you are not currently doing the job/project/internship (e.g. developed vs. develop). Otherwise, use present tense.          If I'm getting interviews but no job/internship offers, do I need to work on my resume?     If I'm getting interviews but no job/internship offers, do I need to work on my resume?         What should if I do if I'm landing interviews but not getting job/internship offers?    If you’re getting interviews, congratulations! Your resume is doing its job!  If you’re getting interviews but not getting jobs/internships after the interviews, your interview prep may need work. Schedule an interview prep appointment with the ECC to prepare for the interview.
