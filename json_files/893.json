Its purpose is to ensure faculty, staff and students have essential information to make informed and safe decisions about International Travel.  All UIC students who travel abroad must enroll in a UIC travel roster and obtain the University of Illinois System’s comprehensive insurance plan or equivalent insurance approved by the UIC Study Abroad Office. All faculty and staff are encouraged to enroll in the portal and to obtain the same insurance policy or one that has the same or higher levels of coverage. All faculty or staff traveling with UIC students must enroll in the University’s International Travel Safety portal and the System’s comprehensive insurance plan.  This policy does not cover faculty, staff or students’ personal travel that is unrelated to work or academic duties at UIC.  Faculty and staff may obtain Gallagher Insurance on UIC-authorized international travel at no cost.
