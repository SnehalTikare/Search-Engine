Psychology currently has 28 tenure-track faculty, 4 Clinical assistant professors, 2 research professors and 8 lecturers. The Department of Psychology offers degrees oriented to understanding the complete human being across different levels of analysis that include the brain, the mind (cognitive and affective processes), the person (individual emotional and attitudinal patterns), the group and community (how members relate to each other and how individual group experience is impacted by cultural and community context). The central goal of the undergraduate and graduate training experience is to provide a contemporary, comprehensive and challenging exploration in understanding the complete human being.

The interdisciplinary approach to faculty research results in active collaborations with faculty in all other UIC colleges, particularly in the Colleges of Education, Engineering and Medicine. Psychology faculty are also actively involved in or direct Inter-College Programs such as the Center for Clinical and Translational Science, Council on Teacher Education, Institute for Health and Research Policy and Neuroscience Cluster Hire Initiative. Psychology faculty are further committed teachers and mentors leading to the largest number of teaching awards of any department in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, including Department Teaching Award of Excellence, as well as several Teaching Recognition Program, Award for Excellence in Teaching and Silver Circle awardees.
