Help us empower students to reach their educational goals and launch their engineering careers.       Student Groups      More than 30 student organizations call UIC College of Engineering home, and hundreds of students participate in them each year. Your gift to support them provides students with professional development, strong networks, and an additional point of access and support.  To support all of our student organizations, we have launched two new funds:   The Engineering Professional Student Organization Fund provides additional resources to our student groups as their membership grows along with the College’s enrollment.  The Engineering Conference Attendance and Travel Fund provides resources for students to attend professional-development events to gain a deeper understanding of their fields and to network with employers. Conferences can provide a valuable career-building function, as students often return with job offers in hand.
