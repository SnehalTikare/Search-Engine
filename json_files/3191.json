There is a non-refundable application fee of $70 for all applicants.  You don’t have to enter and submit all application information in one sitting. You can return to the system as many times as you need to. You can also return to the system checklist as often as you like to see what materials have been uploaded and verified as received.   Transcripts  Submit unofficial copies of official registrar-issued transcripts from institutions where you earned a degree and from all colleges and universities attended. A link to upload these will be in the application provided.   GRE  Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are recommended for all applicants and required for:   Financial aid applicants including those seeking assistantships, fellowships, and all BHIS stipends and tuition waivers  Applicants with no prior Master’s degree  Applicants holding a Master’s degree with a cumulative GPA less than 3.5/4.0  Applicants with degrees awarded outside the United States and Canada   Scores should be sent directly from Education Testing Service to UIC. If you have taken the GRE within the past five years, you must request that scores be sent from ETS to UIC. Our ETS Institutional Code is 1851 .  The minimum required GRE scores are 152 Verbal and 151 Quantitative. We also require at least a 3.0 GPA. Keep in mind that your entire application package is taken into consideration, not just your GRE test scores!  Applicants from foreign schools are considered if they are sponsored by an accepted referral service, such as AFGRAD or AMIDEAST.   Personal Statement  Submit a statement that addresses your goals for graduate study, career development, teaching and research experience.   Letters of recommendation  Submit three letters of recommendation in support of your application.  Letters must be on letterhead. Letter writers should explain the context in which they have worked with and know you. Letter writers should explore your scholarly abilities, personal professionalism, personal organizational skills, and any other insights into your qualities that demonstrate your suitability for work at the doctorate level.   Curriculum vitae  Submit a current CV, including scholarly activities and publications to date.      International Students   Minimum English competency test  If English is not your native language, you might need to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) , the exam of the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) or the PTE-Academic. Check out the International Requirements to see if this applies to you.  Scores must be submitted to UIC directly using the institutional code 1851.  Our program has higher minimum score requirements than the Graduate College. We also require Test of Written English, with scores in range of 5-6.
