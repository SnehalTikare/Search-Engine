Most undergraduate students are dependent. All graduate and professional students are independent. Dependent students must report parental income information on the FAFSA. Dependency Status is not based on whether a student lives with a parent, is financially self-supportive, or claimed as dependent on a parents’ taxes.  Student Aid Report (SAR):  After receiving a FAFSA, the Federal Processor will send a Student Aid Report (SAR) electronically. The SAR lists all information submitted on the FAFSA and explains the EFC calculation. Review the SAR for accuracy and log on to the FAFSA website to make corrections.
