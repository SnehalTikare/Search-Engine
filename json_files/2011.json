Our scholars are examining ways toÂ design smart, sustainable, and resilient cities. They are investigating how climate change, waste production, water contamination, and other factors demand adaptation in the way we live. They are developing novel ways to evaluate the structural health of the built world around us, from roads to bridges to pipelines, and they are envisioning the next-generation modes of transportation that may reshape the ways we cross land, water, and air.  The research areas page of this website is a useful resource for researchers in our fields who are interested in collaboration and prospective students who seek research mentors. Here, you can find experts by area. We also encourage you to visit our labs page , a gateway to some of the CME research groups that have developed websites for their scholarship.  Civil and materials engineering researchers who would like to present their work to our faculty as part of a workshop or seminar are invited to visit our seminars page for more information.
