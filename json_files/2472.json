The main research projects are:   Metasearch engine utilizes\n\t\t\t\tnumerous search engines to search the Web and integrates the results to serve the users.  Retrieval of pictures based on approximate contents. This has wide applications in entertainment, education, law enforcement and military\n\t\t\t\tindustries.  Automatic analysis of unstructured  (in natural language)  data . Consumer\n\t\t\t\tproduct surveys can be analyzed and concisely described without examining individual documents.  Relationships between names of attributes/entities . Relationships are in the form of synonyms, homonyms, is-a relationships and\n\t\t\t\taggregate relationships. This information is useful in schema integration.  Data mining, text and Web mining. This\n\t\t\t\tresearch seeks to develop new methods of extracting underlying patterns from data, text and Web pages, and/or building\n\t\t\t\tpredictive models.  Parallelization in database environment. This is important when the amount of data is huge, there is large number of users and\n\t\t\t\tstringent time requirements are imposed.  Active databases .\n\t\t\t\tThese types of databases have immense applications in computer systems, traffic management systems, security trading\n\t\t\t\tand communication networks.  Data replication in mobile computing .\n\t\t\t\tMinimize charges by using appropriate data replication schemes.  Fuzzy relational systems .\n\t\t\t\tThis allows imprecise queries to be answered in the presence of imprecise data.  Visualization and integration of heterogeneous information . Applications include geospatial databases containing XML and multimedia information.  Moving objects databases. Research\n\t\t\t\tissues include modeling of dynamic location information, uncertainty management, spatio-temporal data access languages,\n\t\t\t\tindexing and scalability issues, data mining (including traffic and location prediction), location dissemination,\n\t\t\t\tprivacy and security, location fusion and synchronization.
