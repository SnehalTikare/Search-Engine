View Special Collections and University Archives hours at Daley Library or Library of the Health Sciences-Chicago .      Plan your visit  To plan your visit, it’s best to make an appointment so we can have your materials ready when you arrive. If you’re not sure which materials you’d like to look at, you may find it helpful to search our online list of archival finding aids , our list of rare book collections or our guide to research the history of UIC . You may also Ask an Archivist for further help.  First-time visitors must register using photo identification, so please bring valid identification, such as a school I.D., drivers license, state I.D. or passport.  Because our materials are valuable and sometimes fragile, we do not permit borrowing and all materials must be viewed in the reading room.  We also limit the kinds of items you may bring into our reading room. Pencils, loose paper, laptops and digital cameras (no flash) are welcome. We provide a secure space for your other items.  Finding Aids  Try the new UIC Special Collections and University Archives Finding Aid Search !
