Ozevin joined reporter Lauren Victory under the bridge to discuss other issues it may have. Watch the segment at https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/02/21/lake-shore-drive-bridge-corrosion-cracks/.  Her research interests focus on sensor development to combine a variety of sensing elements and to develop new structural evaluation methods for understanding the damage states using variety of structural health monitoring techniques. She uses multi-physic models to understand the wave propagation phenomena on various structures to develop simple damage characterization methodologies that can be used as embedded algorithms into low power wireless sensor nodes.
