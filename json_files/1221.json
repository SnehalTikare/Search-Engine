The University complies with applicable federal and state laws to achieve an environment for study, work, and public engagement that is free from sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual misconduct in all of its forms.   What is Sexual Harassment?   In employment , sexual harassment is defined as any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any conduct of a sexual nature when  submission to such conduct is either explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment; and  submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making decisions about employment; or  such conduct interferes with job performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.      In education , sexual harassment is defined as any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors made to a student by an executive member, administrative staff, or faculty member; or any conduct of a sexual nature that substantially interferes with the student's educational performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.   A hostile environment may be created through unwelcome, severe or pervasive acts:   Sexual advances  Fondling  Shoulder massages  Pinching  Grabbing  Lewd hand gestures  Leering  Suggestive comments  Off-color jokes  Comments on physical attributes  Discussions of sexual exploits  Lewd voicemail messages  Displays of sexually suggestive pictures, photos, cartoons, screen savers  Lewd e-mails or texts  Sexually suggestive posts on social media  Facebook pictures with sexual overtones   The University holds harassers accountable for their actions and issues sanctions consistent with employees' and students' rights.
