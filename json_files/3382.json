We are an undergraduate and a graduate program within the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science. There are 8 tenured and tenure-track professors in our statistics program. The size is comparable to statistics departments in some other institutions. Faculty members have a diverse range of both teaching and research interests.  In terms of research, there is an intellectually stimulating working environment where many of the faculty members collaborate with each other and with doctoral students. Faculty research is well-supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Health, among other prestigious funding agencies. Together, the statistics program faculty members offer a nice array of research. The combined research areas include many cutting-edge statistics areas currently in high demand. They include but are not limited to, the areas of big data analysis, bioinformatics, design of experiment, empirical likelihood, financial mathematics, functional data analysis, high dimensional statistical inference, machine Learning, nonparametetric and semiparametric statistics, stochastic analysis, and many more.  The statistics program also provides a dynamic environment for teaching. The curriculum aims at making students ready for either a non-academic career or further study in graduate school depending on their interests. It is a fertile ground for both core research and collaborative research across disciplines. The faculty are well-known for excellence in research and teaching, and have received numerous honors .  At the undergraduate level, the statistics program offers a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Statistics with two possible tracks, or concentrations. The Statistical Theory and Methods concentration provides a classical training in statistics, ideally suited for students planning to attend graduate school in statistics or other data-focused disciplines. The Applied Statistics concentration is more interdisciplinary, allowing students to select an application area of focus, such as biology and economics, to complement their basic statistical training. This concentration is well-suited for students planning for a career in government or industry.  At the graduate level, the statistics program offers several means for earning a Master of Science (MS) degree in statistics , as well as a rigorous program leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree. The curriculum is updated on a regular basis to reflect industry trends. Each program offers a rigorous and up-to-date curriculum, emphasizing both theory and applications in order to train the students to become the best statisticians and future leaders for academia, government, and industry.
