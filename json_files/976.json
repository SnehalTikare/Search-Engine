Scholarships are awarded based on a student's academic achievement, athletic ability, field of study, special talents, etc.  Notify SFAS of All Scholarships  Students must report outside scholarships so SFAS can recalculate aid eligibility. If students have remaining unmet need or have not exceeded their cost of attendance (COA) , other awards will not be affected. Once federal need or COA is met, outside assistance may result in the reduction of Federal Work Study, student loans, or other grants and scholarships to remain compliant with federal regulations. If SFAS is notified that a student will receive outside assistance after receiving a refund, they will be 100% responsible for repaying any refund adjustment.
