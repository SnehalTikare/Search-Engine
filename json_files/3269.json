UIC Business Scholarships    UIC Business is committed to supporting a talented, well-rounded, hardworking and diverse student body throughout their undergraduate and graduate education. While students with financial need often receive assistance from government resources, it is almost never enough. Merit and need-based scholarships are essential in attracting and retaining UIC Business students.

Focusing on undergraduates, it gives our students the “soft skills” they need to compete and succeed in the business world. This one-of-a-kind experience is exclusive to our students, and they are required to participate in it from their first days in class. iLEAD gives them a competitive edge before they begin their careers, by helping them hone their presentation skills and build their confidence. By supporting the iLEAD program you are helping our students accomplish a variety of skills (stronger communication, personal growth, teamwork, and professional presence) in both a conventional and unconventional manner.

Working closely with faculty and business professionals, Business Scholars receive a solid foundation in business coupled with in-depth knowledge and technical skills to ensure they excel in the competitive world of international business.
