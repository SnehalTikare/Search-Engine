The competition, held at the Kennedy Space Center, challenged teams to design and build a robot that can dig and collect basaltic regolith simulant and autonomously navigate a simulated Martian terrain—objectives designed to help NASA find innovative ways to excavate well-insulated water ice. Chicago EDT beat 44 teams including Purdue University, Illinois Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, and UIUC in its fifth year participating in the competition.
