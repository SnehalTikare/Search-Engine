A paper by Yarin and his team members’ about using bubble recoil to cool microelectronics was recently published in the journal Nature Microgravity . The work, titled “Swing-like Pool Boiling on Nano-Textured Surfaces for Microgravity Applications Related to Cooling of High-Power Microelectronics,” originated from the team’s work on a NASA-funded project. Stories about the team’s research have been published in Phys.org, Engineering.com, AZoNano.com, New electronics.co.uk, and UIC News.  The original story from UIC News can be found at Bubble Recoil Could be Used to Cool Microchips, Even in Space .      Modified on June 06, 2019                     ",
