The DAC meets monthly to advance initiatives within the department. DAC meetings are open to any member of the Psychology Department. The DAC strongly encourages feedback and participation from all members of our community.  Structure of the Diversity Advancement Committee  The Diversity Advancement Committee steering committee consists of three faculty members and two graduate students. The faculty members of DAC are appointed by the Department Head and serve three-year terms coincident with the program chair positions. The student members are nominated by the graduate students and officially appointed by the DAC faculty members. The two students co-chair the DAC Student Advisory Board (DAC-SAB). The Department Head, the Director of Undergraduate Studies, the Director of Graduate Studies and the two Committee of Graduate Students (COGS) representatives and two Department support staff members serve as ex officio steering committee members.
