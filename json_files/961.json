Degree Programs     JD Programs    JD Concentration in International Human Rights Distinguish yourself with a concentration in the growing field of international human rights law.  Joint JD/LLM in International Business & Trade Law  Enhance your marketability by specializing in international business and trade law.  JD-Level International Law Courses Additionally, a number of international law courses are available at the JD level.      LLM & MJ Programs    LLM in International Business & Trade Law  (for practicing attorneys) Develop a solid foundation in the rules, regulations, and legal approaches underlying international business and trade.

Bar Considerations for International Degree Candidates   In addition to a bar examination, there are character, fitness, and other qualifications for admission to the bar in every U.S. jurisdiction. Applicants are encouraged to determine the requirements for any jurisdiction in which they intend to seek admission by contacting the jurisdiction. Addresses for all relevant agencies are available through the National Conference of Bar Examiners.  Please be aware that earning a U.S. LLM does not guarantee eligibility to sit for the bar exam in IL, NY, CA, or any other U.S. state. The respective state’s Board of Law Examiners and not UIC John Marshall Law School determines eligibility to sit for the exam. Degree candidates should consult the respective Board of Law Examiners’ website to review the rules and requirements for any and all states in which they intend to practice.
