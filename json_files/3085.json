This cannot include more than two non-ECE courses. Students who want to register for more than three courses must obtain approval from the department’s director of graduate studies via formal petition (forms available from the Student Affairs office). Students who are registered for more than three courses without this formal approval will have a registration hold placed on their account. A hold will prohibit any further registration (add or drop). The department will then work with the Graduate College to drop students from courses so that the total number of courses is reduced to three. The department will decide which courses will be dropped.  If an ECE course is cross-listed with another department, students must register for the course using the ECE course code to earn credit toward the degree. For example, if a student plans to take ECE 466 but registers for the course under the cross-listed computer science code, CS 466, that student will not earn degree credit for the course. He or she must register for ECE 466.  Students who have completed the maximum allowable non-ECE credits should not register for additional non-ECE coursework. Registration in non-ECE coursework is not required for the degree but is allowed with prior approval from the department’s director of graduate studies, up to the maximum allowed, via petition (forms available from the Student Affairs office).  The limit above refers to coursework only, not to research or seminar credits, meaning that this cap does not apply to ECE 595, ECE 598, and ECE 599.   This policy was revised effective December 18, 2017.
