They hold degrees from prestigious universities across the United States and around the world, and they balance a commitment to leading-edge research with a dedication to the advancement of their students.  Research in mechanical and industrial engineering at UIC offers breadth and depth. Areas of current investigation include MEMS (microelectrical mechanical systems), virtual reality, combustion, environmental science, thermal science, dynamics and control, mechatronics, bioengineering, manufacturing and processing. In addition to their laboratory research, our faculty actively contribute to the field as the authors and editors of reference books; as editors, associate editors, and reviewers for major journals; as advisors to a growing number of PhD students; and as bridges between UIC and industry.  The department’s five-year research budget totals $13 million and is supported primarily by government agencies and industry via grants, contracts, and gifts. Mechanical and industrial engineering faculty work primarily in UIC’s Engineering Research Facility, which houses multiple research laboratories, a Class 100 clean room, two virtual reality CAVE theaters, a comprehensive MEMS research center, advanced CAD/CAM and computer lab facilities, and lecture rooms. They also have full access to UIC Engineering’s new building across Taylor Street, which includes an advanced high-bay lab for structural testing, open laboratories, and other resources.
