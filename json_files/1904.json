COVID-19 Updates and Resources         Breadcrumbs   Honors College    Faculty and Fellows    Become a Fellow        Become a Fellow          If you are interested in becoming a Faculty Fellow please fill out the Honors College Fellows Application and email it, along with your current c.v., to Michele McCrillis, Assistant Dean of Curriculum and Outreach Programs, at mmccrill@uic.edu .  Applications are reviewed and approved by the Honors Council, which meets several times a semester.  Serving as a Faculty Fellow is a great opportunity to welcome incredible students as members of the academic community, encourage them to identify with that community, and develop a relationship with students that fosters such identification.  Honor College Faculty Fellows serve as sources of information about the department, the campus, graduate school, and careers. You will also serve as a sponsor and advocate for the student – encouraging the student to take advantage of academic opportunities, calling departmental colleagues’ attention to the student’s abilities, writing letters of recommendation, etc. Faculty Fellows encourage students to pursue academic excellence and serve as role models of scholarly achievement.  Additionally, Faculty Fellows have opportunities to develop and teach seminars and core courses in the College, join advisory committees, and serve the College as grant and scholarship application reviewers, student organization advisors, capstone supervisors, etc.  Prospective and new Fellows participate in an orientation meeting individually with the Assistant Dean of Curriculum and Outreach Programs.  In the orientation, new Fellows learn about their role and responsibilities as a personal mentor to undergraduate Honors students at the sophomore level or above.   Information about the student experience in the College–from recruitment to graduation– is covered, including Honors Activities and the Honors Capstone Research Project.  Once their application is approved, new Fellows are given a link to the Honors College Faculty Fellow Handbook, which outlines the mission and activities of the College and the role of the Fellow in detail.  Please contact Dean Michele McCrillis with any questions. You can reach her at mmccrill@uic.edu or 312-413-2260.
