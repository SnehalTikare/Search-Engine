Some students must submit additional documentation to SFAS in order to verify information they reported on the FAFSA. If additional information is required, SFAS will send you an email requesting specific documentation. It is important that you submit any required documentation in a timely manner. Students must submit all documents to SFAS by August 1st. You cannot be awarded aid until all required documentation is received and processed.  Verification  Approximately 25% of student applicants are selected each year for verification. If selected, the SFAS will provide you a link to print a Verification Worksheet. You and your parents/spouse must complete the worksheet and return it along with all requested additional documentation. This will include, but is not limited to, your official federal tax information for 2018 (prior-prior tax year). This information may be provided using the IRS Data Retrieval option on your 2020-2021 FAFSA application, or by providing an official IRS Tax Return Transcript. To view a sample of an IRS Tax Return Transcript click here . Those submitting an official IRS Tax Return Transcript or those who are not required to file a 2018 federal tax return per the IRS regulations, will be required to submit any W-2 forms for 2018.  SFAS will review the documentation you submit and make any necessary corrections to your FAFSA information. The verification process generally takes two to three weeks. Once completed, you will be notified via email.  Other Required Documentation  Sometimes the federal processor flags a student’s FAFSA and requires additional documentation to verify FAFSA data. Students might be required to submit documentation regarding:   Citizenship  Selective Service  Bankruptcy  Loan Default  Loan Discharge  Veteran Status  Social Security Number/Name/Date of Birth Discrepancies  Federal Aid Overpayments   If any of this additional documentation is required, SFAS will send you a request via email.
