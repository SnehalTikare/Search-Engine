(2007), M.Sc. (2009), and Ph.D. (2014) degrees in Computer Science from the University of Crete (Greece) while working as a research assistant in the Distributed Computing Systems Lab at FORTH.  Prior to joining UIC, I was a postdoctoral research scientist in the Computer Science Department\nat Columbia University , and a member of the Network Security Lab.\nMore information is available in my resume .  I’m looking for excited and motivated students to work with. Information for PhD applications at UIC can be found here .  Research  My research interests span several areas of security and privacy . In the past\nfew years I have focused on understanding the security limitations of online\nsocial networks and web services, exploring the privacy threats that users\nface, and designing robust countermeasures . I’m also actively exploring the\nshortcomings of authentication and authorization mechanisms, and the robustness of \nbot-prevention systems. Ultimately my research focuses on understanding the Web’s\nthreat landscape and developing countermeasures and privacy-preserving techniques for\nbetter protecting users.
