Welcome to Arab American Cultural Center!   Ahlan Wasahlan ! In the Arab region and its diasporas, people say Ahlan Wasahlan to welcome guests or visitors.

Stay Calm and wash your hands  In solidarity  The ArabAmCC team (Nesreen, Marie, Zeina, Sief, Yaz, and Mona)         Ramadan Is Coming      Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic Lunar Calendar. The month is 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the moon. Fasting during Ramadan is the fourth pillar of Islam. It is expected to commence on April 23 until May 23 (exact dates may vary by a day or so depending on the sighting of the moon).  What do Muslims Do in Ramadan?   Fasting for self-restraint and God consciousness-no food, no drink, no smoking, no sexual relations.  Spirituality and worship: increased prayers, acts of worship and reflection, contemplation and recitation of the Qur’an, increased acts of kindness and forgiveness.  Charity and Community: increased acts of charity (zakat), feeding others who are fasting or who cannot afford to eat, community iftar (breaking of the fast), appreciating and remembering family and loved ones.
