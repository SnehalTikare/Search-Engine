NAFTA Professional Worker  O-1 Workers of Extraordinary Ability  Permanent Residence      Quick Guide to Hiring for International Faculty, Staff, and Scholars   Most internationals coming to work, teach, perform research, or other  related duties at UIC will need to be sponsored through the Office of  International Services. The following is a list of common non-immigrant  classifications that allow an individual to work in the United States,  and which require OIS/UIC sponsorship.  There are other non-immigrant classifications that do not require UIC sponsorship, such as B-1 , WB , and “pending Permanent Residence not based on UIC employment,” among others.  Keep in mind that the information below is only a basic guide for  UIC-sponsored internationals. OIS will make all final determinations regarding the most appropriate non-immigrant classification for each  individual case.     H-1B Temporary Skilled Workers   Basic Requirements: Bachelor’s degree or  higher. The person must have the degree required by the position, and  there must be a direct relationship between the person’s degree and  their work. H-1B status allows immigrant intent. Appropriate for both  non-tenure track and tenure track positions.  Program limit: Up to 3 years at a time, for up to 6 years total. Extensions beyond six years may be possible under certain circumstances.  Restrictions: Those individuals subject to  the Two-Year Home Residence Requirement, 212(e), as a result of previous  J-1 status do not qualify unless 1) the J-1 visitor completes the home  residence requirement or 2) obtains a recommendation from Department of  State for a waiver. A minimum salary is required, however, the minimum  acceptable salary will not be known until after the sponsorship process  has been initiated by OIS.  Agencies involved: U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS)  Processing times:   New employment : 4-6 months normally, or 3-4 months if Premium Processing is used to expedite service.  First time employment at UIC in H-1B status  Does not currently hold H-1B status elsewhere (a.k.a. “Portability”)    New employment, Portability : 2-3 months  International currently holds H-1B status with another employer  Premium Processing not necessary unless international travel is planned shortly    Extension: 2-3 months  Extension of current UIC employment without change in position    Amendment : 2-3 months  Change in UIC H-1B’s current employment, i.e. a promotion  Discuss case with OIS in advance     Fees : Appropriate departmental fees will apply.     J-1 Exchange Visitors   Basic Requirements : May be used for short  to medium-term visitors. Funding may come from various sources: UIC,  personal funds, or outside sources, such as one’s home government. The J  program has multiple “categories;” OIS will determine the appropriate  category for each case based upon information provided on the DS-2019  Request Form. All J-1 categories must demonstrate sufficient English  proficiency. Other requirements depend upon the category:   Short-Term Scholar, Research Scholar/Professor, and Specialist: Must have at least some graduate education, plus demonstrated expertise in his or her field.  Student Intern: Must be currently enrolled and pursuing a  degree at a postsecondary academic institution outside the U.S. The UIC  internship must fulfill the educational objectives for his or her  foreign degree program.   Program limit : Limits range from 6 months to 5 years depending on the J-1 category.  Restrictions : J-1 status does not allow  immigrant-intent and is therefore not appropriate for tenure-track  positions. The “12-month bar” prohibits a person from becoming a  Research Scholar/Professor for 12 months if he or she was previously in J  status for more than 6 of the previous 12 months in a category other  than Short Term Scholar. The “24-month bar” prohibits a person from  becoming a Research Scholar/Professor for 24 months, if they were  previously a Research Scholar/Professor.  Agencies involved : OIS is authorized by the  U.S. Department of State to issue a Form DS-2019, which the Exchange  Visitor would use to apply for a visa at a U.S. Consulate or Embassy  abroad.  Processing times : Up to 10 business days. Please note, however, that applications should be submitted to OIS at  least 2-3 months prior to the intended start date.  Fees : Appropriate departmental fees will apply.     TN - NAFTA Professional Worker   Basic Requirements : Must be a Canadian or  Mexican citizen who has been admitted on a temporary basis to engage in  business on a professional level under the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA). Not appropriate for tenure-track positions.  Program limit : Granted for up to one year at a time and is renewable annually for an indefinite period.  Restrictions : Must have Canadian or Mexican  citizenship. Their field must fall under the list of professions in  the NAFTA agreement, and they must have the appropriate degree listed. A  list of NAFTA Professions can be found in our TN information .  Agencies involved :   USCIS – if OIS processes an extension or change of status within the U.S.  USCBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) if they are entering the U.S. directly in this status.   Processing times :   By petition to USCIS : (if in the country and/or travel is  not wanted), approximately 2-3 months  unless Premium Processing is used  to expedite service  By border crossing with inspection : immediate (See OIS TN information .)   Fees :   Appropriate departmental fees will apply  At border : check with border posts for current fees      O-1 Workers of Extraordinary Ability   Basic Requirements/Restrictions : Individual must be in the top 5% of their field internationally ,  and their preeminence must be documented. Often used for people who do  not qualify for H-1B status because of the two-year home residence  requirement due to prior J status. Change of status in the U.S. is not  possible if the person is subject to the Two-Year Home Residence  Requirement. For those individuals, travel and obtaining new entry visas  would be necessary for the O-1 and their dependents to obtain O status  after the USCIS approves the person for O-1 classification.  Program limit : Three years initially, after which it may be extended (indefinitely) in one year increments.  Agencies involved : Regional service center of USCIS  Processing times : Approximately 3-6 months, unless Premium Processing is used to expedite service.  Fees : Appropriate departmental fees will apply.
