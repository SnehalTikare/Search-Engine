Applicants are considered for admission by the computer science graduate admissions committee.   MS program applicants are expected to have earned an undergraduate degree in computer science or a closely related field. Download our master’s degree booklet for an overview of this program.  PhD program applicants typically have earned a master’s degree in computer science or a related field. Exceptional applicants who seek to enter the PhD program with only an undergraduate degree may be considered for what is called “direct admission.”        stuff   Applying and requirements       Application deadlines  Admission requirements  Application requirements  Core courses  Non-degree         info   Fall   February 15: all PhD and international MS applicants  January 15: recommended deadline for PhD applicants to be considered for fellowships  June 15: New extended fall 2020 deadline for U.S. applicants to the MS program   Spring   July 15: all PhD applicants and MS international applicants  November 1: MS domestic applicants            Admission Requirements    Bachelor’s degree in computer science, computer engineering, or a closely related field.
