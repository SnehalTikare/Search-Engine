There are many ways to pay for college . Federal aid, loans, grants, scholarships and student jobs can make college more affordable and accessible to students. Graduate students can reduce tuition and other costs with assistantships and fellowships , as well as grants outside UIC.               Undergraduate tuition and fees  Estimate of one semester tuition and fees for your program      Graduate and professional tuition and fees  Complete breakdown of costs      Financial aid  Sources of financial aid and deadlines                We're here to help   “About 84 percent of our students receive some type of financial assistance for their educations. In 2017-18, we helped our undergraduates receive nearly $300 million in federal, state, institutional and private funding.”     — Kiely Fletcher, executive director, office of student financial aid and scholarships   More about financial aid            Scholarships        Scholarships vary by type of student:   First-year students are considered for scholarships based on their UIC applications. They may submit additional forms for federal or merit-based aid.  Transfer undergraduates, continuing undergraduates, ROTC cadets and non-resident undergraduates have several scholarship, grant, and waiver opportunities .  The Honors College offers merit scholarships to first-year students based on their UIC applications. It also awards merit scholarships to transfer students, current Honors College students and others. The listserv ossp@listserv.uic.edu keeps students up to date on opportunities.  Graduate students can seek assistantships, fellowships and other aid through their colleges.  For professional school students and undergraduates, the Office of External Fellowships advises on competitive awards.  Find and apply to available scholarships at UIC with the UIC SnAP website .       Honors College scholarships     UIC SnAP     More about scholarships              Jobs on campus        More than 3,200 students work on-campus, while others work near the Chicago-land area or return to a job at home during break periods to pay for college.   On-campus jobs are a convenient option and offer flexible scheduling.  Working a part-time job during college can provide spending money, supplement scholarships or other financial aid, and students gain valuable experiences for eventual full-time employment.    The Student Employment Office , part of Career Services, helps connect job-seeking students with UIC departments that are hiring.

Student Employment Office              Assistantships and fellowships        Colleges and other units at UIC offer graduate students the opportunity to teach, conduct research or do administrative work in paid assistantships . Assistants receive stipends, tuition waivers, certain fee waivers and the option to buy low-cost health insurance. While most assistantships are found through individual colleges, some are listed on UIC’s job board .  Internal UIC fellowships include university fellowships and Graduate College fellowships . For specialized, competitive opportunities, external fellowships are available from foundations or other grant-making bodies outside UIC.
