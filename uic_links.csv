The mini-profiles below offer a few examples of the thousands of rewarding careers pursued by alumni of UIC’s undergraduate program in computer science. Kevin Bell, BS ’19 Software Engineer Discover What are some of your day-to-day tasks? Writing code, prepping for product installs, and learning about and implementing security tools. I’m a part of the Ninjitsu team at Discover, and I work on the web platform using Java. What’s great about your job? The culture at Discover was the main factor that made me want to work here in the first place. Everyone is kind, professional, and understanding. Also, I’m learning a lot in a short amount of time, so it’s great for growth. What was the most valuable student organization you joined, and why? Black Tech Scholars because it brought awareness to the fact that there are people like me who want to help people like me. Now, I have a strong feeling of needing to pay back that effort. Would you recommend the College of Engineering to new applicants? If so, why? Yes. If you want a challenge to grow and to succeed in life, then UIC is the perfect place for you. There’s so much to learn, so many people to meet, and so many opportunities to come from the experience that it’s a no-brainer to recommend the College of Engineering. Emily Austin, BS ’16 Program Manager AstrumU What are some of your day-to-day tasks? I talk with people to solve their problems and keep work moving forward. I sometimes get clarification from one person or need to gather a group to decide how we’ll tackle a problem. I balance priorities between developers, data scientists, product managers, and sales managers in planning workloads. I collaborate with others to define company road maps and goals in a language that crosses technical and non-technical teams. I maintain internal tools that help the engineering team move smoothly. What was your favorite course? CS 450 Introduction to Networking . It has a lot of fun concepts and leaves you wondering how it all works. The course was tough, but I took it with friends, and we studied and struggled together. After the course, I learned that I don’t want to specialize in networking or work on it day-to-day, but I enjoy discussing concepts and seeing how networking relates to everything in technology. What was the most valuable student organization you joined, and why? The Association for Computing Machinery . This is where I met friends when I first joined UIC. I found people with similar interests, peers in my classes to study with, and events where I could learn more about the technical field. In my third and fourth years, I was vice president and president, respectively. I learned more about leadership, interfaced with external companies and university staff, and got to welcome students to the organization who reminded me of myself when I joined UIC. Fun fact about you that few people are aware of: I play Magic the Gathering limited format. I’ve been to Grand Prix in Seattle and Portland and played against the director of Magic R&D in a random matchup.

To accelerate the representation of women in tech, our computer science department has received a grant—one of the largest in College of Engineering history—to put UIC on the forefront of the national effort to close the gender gap. The resulting program is called Break Through Tech Chicago . UIC also is committed to providing a support network to benefit female computer science students as they progress through their undergraduate years. The centerpiece of that network is our Women in Computer Science (WiCS) organization, which has nearly 200 student, alumni, and faculty members. This page will get you acquainted with our programs for women in CS at UIC. Break Through Tech Chicago We believe that a crucial strategy for closing the gender gap is to encourage more women to choose computer science majors and to provide them with an excellent education. Break Through Tech Chicago creates new pathways into the tech field for undergraduate women, even those who have never considered studying computer science. It allows students to learn about the broad range of technology careers that are out there—yes, coding, but also user-experience design, web development, cybersecurity, and data analytics—and get started on the courses that will prepare them for those careers. Our Break Through Tech Chicago team wants to hear from students at UIC, community colleges, and high schools who are interested in participating in these programs. We also want to hear from Chicago-area employers who can host students for one of the immersive internships that are a defining feature of Break Through Tech. Follow the links below to get in touch. Get involved with Break Through Tech Chicago Graduate icon Opportunities for students People Icon Opportunities for employers testimonial Break Through Tech is thrilled to partner with the computer science department at UIC and build upon their successes of the last several years. Our experience in New York has shown us that a deep partnership with a public university that has both scale and diversity, the delivery of a continuity of programming that supports women and other underrepresented groups throughout their college journey and innovative partnerships with the industry players within the city is a formula that delivers transformation results for both the students and the tech ecosystem. Judith Spitz, PhD | Executive Director, Break Through Tech Women in Computer Science at UIC WiCS’ primary goal is to support and promote women in computer science, providing a social, technical, and networking community at UIC.

That endeavor may involve giving us all greater peace of mind online by improving the security of our personal data and communications. It might mean developing forms of artificial intelligence that collaborate with, rather than simply compete with, human beings. It includes finding new ways to use technology in classrooms to teach and learn, and novel expressions of data as compelling, useful visuals. In our department, methods of improving quality of life extend to animals, too, as our faculty work on computational methods to understand wild animal populations and ensure their future viability and health. One of the concepts that attracts today’s undergraduates to computer science is the fact that computing is stitched into nearly everything we touch, see, and do on a daily basis. If you change computing, you change the world. That idea is what drives UIC computer science researchers, too. Our faculty design original investigations, pursue grants, and publish work widely with the goal of increasing our overall understanding and command of computing in our society today. Other researchers in computer science, whether just starting their careers or highly accomplished in the field, are encouraged to join our community of scholars as colleagues or as external collaborators.

REUs are competitive (with students chosen for the research positions by application) and often are held at universities other than your home institution. They are sponsored with funding from the National Science Foundation and typically come with a stipend that you can use to cover living expenses and other costs. REUs make excellent résumé entries and offer valuable hands-on experience that you can talk about in job interviews. If you have your eye on a master’s degree or PhD after graduation, REUs provide a head start on building your research experience and could give you insight on what you might like to pursue in graduate school. Think of REUs as a great way to get research experience while trying out living in a different place.

Born in Buffalo, New York, he completed his undergraduate work in mathematics at Yale University and received his master’s degree in 1986 and his PhD in 1989, both in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Beginning in January 2001, he served for two years as the program director of the Theory of Computing Program at the National Science Foundation, managing the multi-million-dollar program through two funding cycles. Today, he is a member of the Department of Homeland Security’s Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee. Dr. Sloan’s scholarly work in computer science is presently divided between two areas. One area is problems near the boundary of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, including learning, knowledge representation, and commonsense reasoning. The other is computer security and privacy public policy, an area in which he collaborates closely with Professor Richard Warner of Chicago-Kent Law School. Together they wrote the book Unauthorized Access: The Crisis in Online Privacy and Security, which was published by CRC Press in 2013. In the past, Dr. Sloan also has published in cryptography and in technical areas of computer security, primarily access control. As department head, Dr. Sloan oversees curriculum development in computer science, ensuring that UIC students receive the education they need to compete and succeed in industry and academia. He has helped the department to keep pace with unchecked growth in student interest, and he has played a significant role in recruiting a large group of new faculty—13 new members in fall 2018 alone. Dr. Sloan engages with a wide range of corporate and academic partners and works actively to secure external funding for computer science initiatives at UIC.

In years three and five, students are primarily at UIC, where they also complete two to three summers of courses and research. The program has two tracks—civil engineering or mechanical engineering—from which students choose in the third year. Throughout the program, students receive guidance from a North Park faculty advisor. Based on the agreement between the two universities, courses taken at North Park as part of this dual-degree program will be accepted as transfer credit toward the UIC Engineering degree, and courses taken at UIC will receive transfer credit from North Park. Students complete the program with a BS in either civil engineering or mechanical engineering from UIC and a BA in physics from North Park. Learn more on North Park University’s website . UIC CUGER program info The Chicago Universities Guaranteed Engineering Roadmap Agreement , or CUGER, is a cooperative relationship between UIC and Chicago State University.

We strongly encourage UIC CS students to sign up for hackathon competitions. Here are some reasons why: Meeting new people. Not just potential employers—who might watch a hackathon for potential new hires—but also fellow students. Developing your résumé. Hackathons let you showcase the skills you’ve developed in class and build some new ones. Enhancing your job interviews. Hackathons make you a more interesting interviewee. You can talk about how you approached a problem, the solutions you considered, and which skills you brought to the table. Winning! (Of course.) More on hackathons Hackathon honor roll info here UIC students have placed highly in these hackathon events: BuiltWorlds Hackathon 2019: Riccardo Pressiani, Matteo Foglio, Guido Muscioni, Francesco Sgherzi, Chiara Gambacorta, and Giulia Soresini, Grand Prize Google Tech Challenge 2019: 3rd place, 5th place MIT Energy Hack 2018: Chirag Soni, MS ’19 BuiltWorlds Hackathon 2018: Giovanni Agugini Bassi, Iacopo Olivo, and Francesco Pinci, all MS ’19 Mobility Hackathon Chicago: The Roiti (team of five MS ’19 students) Research Experiences for Undergraduates Research experiences for undergraduates —called REUs for short—offer undergraduate students the opportunity to complete career-building research projects over the summer. REUs are competitive (with students chosen for the research positions by application) and often are held at universities other than your home institution. They are sponsored with funding from the National Science Foundation and typically come with a stipend that you can use to cover living expenses and other costs. REUs make excellent résumé entries and offer valuable hands-on experience that you can talk about in job interviews. If you have your eye on a master’s degree or PhD after graduation, REUs provide a head start on building your research experience and could give you insight on what you might like to pursue in graduate school. Think of REUs as a great way to get research experience while trying out living in a different place.

The high school computer science class is a recent graduation requirement for Chicago Public School (CPS) high school students, and Tse and Chen taught cybersecurity and robotics in three sections of teacher Cindy Lilagan’s honors classes. Tse heard about the program after reading about Dale Reed’s involvement in bringing computer science instruction to CPS schools . Reed, a clinical professor and director of undergraduate recruitment at UIC, was interested in seeing how high school students would relate to and understand more advanced computer science curriculum. Chen has served as a teaching assistant (TA) for Reed for four semesters. Tse and Chen were accepted by Lilagan and Jones Prep to teach the course. Chen said the use of robotics could teach the students cybersecurity concepts: when a student writes code, they can spoof each other’s robots, intercept and break one another’s encryption signals, and use Caesar’s cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption methods, where each plain text letter is replaced by another set number or position down the alphabet. “The students knew some of this already, but we also went over how things are hacked in their social life—how advertising companies get their information online, for example,” Chen said. Upcoming lessons would involve battles between the student’s robots. With CPS classes moved online due to Covid19, the future of Tse and Chen’s involvement in the program for this semester is uncertain. They finished designing the entire curriculum, but some of the material—including the robot battles—cannot easily translate online. “Miss Lilagan said it’s possible to host a Google meetup or hangout, but some of CPS online learning is up in the air. Some students do not have access,” Tse said. For Tse, helping expose high schoolers to computer science is a passion. Tse was on the path to becoming a doctor, and holds a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Case Western University. After shadowing a few doctors, she had a change of heart, just before graduation. Tse discovered computer science through her younger sister, and decided to return to school for a second bachelor’s degree, after working with Girls Who Code , a nonprofit that teaches women coding and computer skills (UIC also offers a Girls Who Code at UIC Club ). Now, Tse is working on a dual bachelor’s/master’s degree in computer science at UIC. “I’m at a crossroads right now. I’m very interested in a PhD in learning sciences intermixed with CS,” Tse said. “I’m also interning as a data engineer, which is very interesting as well.” Tse is working with Reed and PhD candidates at UIC, getting a sense for what life as a PhD student would be like. Her internship is with Synchrony Financial, where she is developing a tool for their enterprise data lake. (Both data lakes and data warehouses are widely used for storing big data, but a data lake is a large pool of raw data, whereas information held in a data warehouse is structured, and has already been processed for a specific purpose.) Tse is helping the transition to data lakes for the company. She worked previously as a summer immersion program instructor with Girls Who Code. “It is so important that students, especially high schoolers, get exposed to computer science,” Tse said. Chen, a junior, is hoping to work with the Jones students, even in a volunteer capacity, perhaps in the fall. He returned over UIC’s spring break to his family’s home in Taiwan, and will complete the school year from overseas. Although he’s been a TA for two years at UIC, Chen has found the experience at Jones to be enlightening. “You can teach hard material in an easier and more understandable way. Even the most difficult material can be taught more simply,” Chen said. Chen is looking forward to his senior year at UIC, and hopes to work as a software engineer after graduation.

The board voted to approve all construction-related activity for UI Health’s new 200,000-square-foot Outpatient Surgery Center and Specialty Clinics building, which will be located at the southeast corner of Wood and Taylor streets. This includes approval for the university to enter into the agreements necessary to finalize the public-private partnership that will provide the majority of financing for the new $194 million building. The board also approved a $117.8 budget for the Computer Design Research and Learning Center, a 125,000-square-foot mixed-use space for UIC’s College of Engineering. The building will be designed to meet LEED Gold certification standards for environmental sustainability and will be located at 900 W. Taylor St., adjacent to Memorial Grove. “UIC’s students, staff and faculty are among Chicago’s most driven and innovative leaders and they need and deserve world-class facilities,” said UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. “These new buildings are an investment in our and Chicago’s future. They will enhance significantly our teaching, research and clinical operations and will allow UIC to advance, grow and flourish.” The Outpatient Surgery Center and Specialty Clinics building will include six floors of patient care space, including eight operating and eight procedure rooms, 48 pre- and post-surgery bays, clinic space for GI, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, transplant and urology clinics, and a pharmacy. “UI Health brings together seven health sciences colleges and a significant portfolio of bench to community research with a world-class, public clinical care delivery system,” said Dr. Robert Barish, vice chancellor for health affairs at UIC. “This building will serve as a new hub for our top-ranked ophthalmology and transplant programs, and we are looking forward to bringing this new, comfortable space to our patients.” Under the public-private partnership between UIC and Provident Resources Group, a 501(c)(3) corporation, Provident will finance nearly three-quarters of the cost of the building through tax-exempt bonds and lease the facility to UI Health during the 30-year term of the bonds. Additional funding will come from the health system and private philanthropy. In November 2019, Bruno and Sallie Pasquinelli pledged $10 million for the project. “UI Health continues to see 5% annual growth in outpatient surgeries across many surgical services lines and the new building will also provide the space needed for our growing specialty clinics,” said Michael Zenn, CEO of University of Illinois Hospital & Clinics. “Using a public-private partnership model will allow us to move forward on an accelerated timeline while working collaboratively with developers, architects, contractors and others to ensure the building will best serve the needs of our community.” The project will be presented to the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board on April 7. Pending approval, groundbreaking is planned for August 2020. Completion of the project is expected in 2022. The Computer Design Research and Learning Center will include a 1,200-square-foot robotics lab and 16,000 square feet of classroom space. It also will be the new home for UIC’s Electronic Visualization Laboratory, an internationally renowned interdisciplinary research lab. “This new building represents the extraordinary momentum of the UIC College of Engineering, which has grown to serve more than 5,300 students each year,” said Peter Nelson, dean of the college. “The building will also serve as an important space for our computer science department, which has seen skyrocketing enrollments, has six specialties ranked in the top 25 nationally and is leading the nation in recruiting world-class faculty members,” Nelson said. Over the last 15 years, the UIC computer science department has grown from 187 undergraduate students to more than 1,400 students, and since 2018, the department has hired 13 new faculty members. The computer science department has approximately $45 million in active research grants, with national CSRankings in: web and information retrieval (7), economics and computation (12), artificial intelligence (17), logic and verification (17), machine learning and data mining (21), and natural language processing (21). The mixed-use space will include research labs and collaborative areas for students and research groups. “Computer science is also an increasingly popular minor among UIC students from a number of programs, like liberal arts and business, so this building will have an impact on many students across campus,” Nelson said. The new building will be the second new construction project for UIC’s College of Engineering in recent years. The Engineering Innovation Building, which is home to the Chicago area’s only high-bay structural research laboratory, opened in July 2019. Groundbreaking is estimated for November 2020 and completion is expected in 2022. This story first appeared on UIC Today .

Efforts will include developing educational opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups at UIC and nearby community colleges to learn about computer science. Efforts will also include creating pathways for computer science students to secure paid internship opportunities during freshman or sophomore year. “We want to see a 12.5% increase in the representation of women graduating from our undergraduate computer science program and we want 100% of those women to have meaningful internships on their resumes when they graduate,” said Robert Sloan, UIC professor and head of computer science. Sloan says the field of computer science has a diversity problem. “Computer science is the only one of the STEM fields where the fraction of women graduates has declined over the past few decades,” he said. “Today, women represent less than 20% of computer science graduates nationally, but 35 years ago more than one-third of graduates were women.” Sloan said women represent 20% of graduates from UIC’s growing undergraduate computer science program, which will spearhead the initiative at UIC. The program is ranked ninth by CSRankings for artificial intelligence and machine learning research among all the nation’s public universities and in the top 25 among all U.S. universities in four other major computer science disciplines: web and information retrieval (7 th ), economics and computation (12 th ), logic and verification (17 th ), and natural language processing (22 nd ). Over the last 15 years, the UIC computer science department, which is part of the university’s College of Engineering, has grown from 187 undergraduate students to more than 1,400 students. “This partnership is an opportunity for the UIC College of Engineering to help change the face of computer science and tech in Chicago and nationally,” Sloan said. “Our country and cities need computer science professionals, developers, researchers and educators and, frankly, we all lose if those individuals represent only a narrow segment of the population.” Sloan said that, contrary to existing stereotypes, teamwork and collaboration are fundamental in computer science. “Diversity in these teams leads to better results,” he said, using the example of improving voice recognition technology to recognize all kinds of voices, not just male voices. To develop the new educational and internship programs for engaging women and underrepresented groups, the college’s computer science department will receive funding from Break Through Tech. Break Through Tech, which announced its expansion into Chicago today, pioneered a similar program, called WiTNY — for Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York — in New York City with City University of New York. “We are proud that UIC was selected as the first university for the national expansion of Break Through Tech,” said Peter Nelson, UIC dean of the College of Engineering. “We look forward to working with Cornell Tech and building a successful program here in Chicago. The Cornell Tech grant to support our efforts is one of the largest grants the UIC College of Engineering has ever received.” “Break Through Tech has a track record of success engaging and graduating women in tech fields and we are eager to partner with them to create programs for Chicago students,” Sloan said. Educational opportunities will include new introductory computer science courses and workshops that teach students how to code and emphasize real-world applications of technology. Unlike many internship programs, the new opportunities for UIC students will be held during the university’s winter break. “Winternships” will provide students with chances to build their resumes with real-world experiences that increase their chances of landing coveted summer tech internships, which are key experiences that tech recruiters look for when evaluating graduates for full-time employment. “Break Through Tech is thrilled to partner with the computer science department at UIC and build upon their successes of the last several years,” said Judith Spitz, executive director of Break Through Tech. “Our experience in New York has shown us that a deep partnership with a public university that has both scale and diversity, the delivery of a continuity of programming that supports women and other underrepresented groups throughout their college journey and innovative partnerships with the industry players within the city is a formula that delivers transformation results for both the students and the tech ecosystem.” New introductory courses and workshops will be held beginning in May 2020 and the first cohort of students in the winternship program are expected to start as early as December 2020.

Lying between the east and west sides of campus and stretching from our north to south, it’s an area that is diverse both ethnically and socioeconomically. Once known as “Hull House neighborhood,” Jane Addams’ original home and the resident’s dining hall still stand as a museum. Other nearby icons include the Christopher Columbus statue and Our Lady of Pompeii church. While University Village bustles with new housing and businesses, Little Italy’s heritage is displayed prominently in the restaurants of Taylor Street. Cultural Attractions National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame Hull-House Museum Arrigo Park Pilsen Located to the south of UIC, Pilsen got its name in the late 19th century from the mostly Czech immigrant population. During the 1960s, there was a large growth in the Latino population in the area and it is now the largest Mexican-American neighborhood in Chicago. The neighborhood celebrates its culture and art with colorful public murals and mosaics, as well as art galleries and museums. The real flavor of the area comes through in the Mexican bakeries, restaurants and groceries that line the active 18th Street corridor. Cultural Attractions National Museum of Mexican Art Murals Dvorak Park Greektown / West Loop Once the home of factories, wholesale markets and warehouses, the West Loop is one of Chicago’s fastest growing neighborhoods. Among the rising loft and condo buildings are tech firms, retailers and restaurants. Located at the north end of the UIC campus, also boasts art galleries, dance companies, designers, boutiques and music venues. At the edge of the neighborhood is Greektown, which holds strong to its Greek heritage and celebrates Greek food and traditions even as the rest of the area transforms. Cultural Attractions National Hellenic Museum Hubbard Street Dance Mary Bartelme Park Navy Pier to Museum Campus / the Loop From the lakefront to the Loop, Navy Pier to Soldier Field shines Chicago’s favorite playground for locals and global visitors alike. Navy Pier is now home to amusement rides and sightseeing, but once hosted the World’s Columbian Exposition. It was later used for Navy training then housed UIC’s first campus. Grant , Millennium and Maggie Daley parks offer fun, culture, sights and sounds for all. Farther south is the Museum Campus with three natural science museums: Adler Planetarium , Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum . Inland, the Loop has everything from tours to shopping to horse carriage rides. Cultural Attractions The Art Institute of Chicago Chicago Shakespeare Theatre Lyric Opera Goodman Theatre Logan Square / Wicker Park If you take the CTA Blue Line “L” train north from UIC, you’ll find the opportunity to explore the wide-ranging communities of Logan Square, Wicker Park and Bucktown. Logan Square, with its proud working-class history, is home to local, farm-to-table and vegan eateries alongside pizzerias and pubs. The prominent, historical boulevards weave wide grassy medians and tree-lined streets through the neighborhood, connecting a string of parks. Wicker Park and Bucktown are known for their art galleries, local boutiques and bookstores alongside great restaurants, nationally recognized designers and major retailers. Cultural Attractions Double Door Concord Music Hall The 606 Logan Boulevard Skate Park Chinatown / Bridgeport South of UIC and Pilsen are the neighborhoods of Chinatown and Bridgeport. As its name suggests, Chinatown is home to a large population of people of Chinese descent. Chinese culture is reflected throughout the community in the many specialty shops, authentic cultural cuisine and signature landmarks. Home to the Chicago White Sox, Bridgeport has also been the home or birthplace of five Chicago mayors. Once a largely Irish-American neighborhood, the area has become one of the city’s more ethnically diverse communities.

Just the facts Topic Facts The Real Deal Weather Chicago is often called the windy city for the politics and because the weather is truly windy and unpredictable. Always check the forecast before heading out for the day so you’re prepared–you never know what the temperature will be at the end of the day. Every Chicagoan knows the closer you are to the lakefront, the colder and windier it gets. Cost of Living Monthly CTA pass : $105 (“L” trains & local bus), Movie ticket : $12.50/adult, Restaurant Dinner : $40/person Museums offer free days and attractions like Lincoln Park Zoo and the “Bean” are always free.

Chicago fundamentals Brush up on these facts about the unique flavor, history and sites of Chicago. With this information you may win a few trivia contests and sound like a lifelong Chicagoan. What makes it Chicago-style? Chicago is a great food city, and some of our distinct flavor comes from Chicago-style pizza and hot dogs. Our deep-dish pizza is unique because of its height and the order of its ingredients: the pizza is covered in cheese then smothered in tomato sauce. Chicago hot dogs sit on a poppy-seed bun covered with mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, pickle spear, pickled peppers and celery salt — and most importantly: no ketchup! Dining in Chicago Architecture Chicago is home to the very first skyscraper. The Home Insurance Building was built in 1885 by William Le Baron Jenney. The Willis (Sears) Tower is present-day Chicago’s largest skyscraper. Built in 1970, the shape was named as the “bundle tube structure” and is famous for its two antennas. See all of Chicago’s great architecture via the many walking and bus tours as well as boat tours on the Chicago River during the warmer months. To see the city from above, check out the observation decks at Willis Tower or the Hancock Building . Chicago Architecture Foundation The Chicago Fire Legend says the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was started by a cow kicking over a lantern. It’s real cause unknown, the fire destroyed three-and-a-half square miles of the city. The Chicago Water Tower was one of the few buildings to survive and still stands today along the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago. The re-built Chicago included fireproof buildings and the first skyscraper made of steel, introducing the city to the industrial revolution. More Chicago history The Loop Most Chicagoans know the Loop to be the rectangular ring of elevated train tracks in the central business district, but some say that the name first referred to the downtown cable car turning loops. The officially designated community area named the Loop, however, expands beyond the “L” train hub. It stretches from Lake Michigan to the Chicago River and south to Roosevelt Road. Inside the Loop you’ll find City Hall, Millennium Park, Chicago Board of Trade, shopping on State Street, great restaurants and a variety of cultural and civic attractions. Explore the Loop The Lakefront/Burnham Plan In 1909, Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett created the Plan of Chicago after studying cities across the world. The commonly-called Burnham Plan was created to improve the city so that it could better serve its growing population. One of the biggest goals of the plan was to improve and increase access to Chicago’s lakefront. Other elements included developing civic and cultural centers, larger streets, railroads and a highway system. It also introduced the grid system to the city. Digital essay on the Plan of Chicago Second City Although Chicago is now the third largest city in the U.S., it was second only to New York for nearly 100 years in the aftermath of the 1871 fire. Some say the nickname Second City first came from New Yorker magazine writer Abbott J. Liebling’s less-than-flattering book Chicago: The Second City . However, others say it arose like the city from the ashes of the great fire when the “second city” of Chicago was built. Whatever the origins, today you’re more likely to hear it called Chi-Town, the Windy City or Sweet Home Chicago.

In the 20th century, new campuses were built in Chicago and later joined together to form a comprehensive learning community. In the last three decades, UIC has transformed itself into one of the top 65 research universities in the United States. UIC: From Pier to Present Take a look back to learn about the history of UIC and how the University came to be an acclaimed research institution with 16 colleges and more than 31,000 students vital to the educational, technological and cultural fabric of the region. Watch UIC: From Pier to Present Alumni We celebrate graduates from every era History in detail Serving Chicago for more than a century Architecture Virtual tour explores historic Netsch campus buildings 1859 to 1945: Early medical roots As part of the University of Illinois, UIC grew to meet the needs of the people of Illinois, but its deepest roots are in health care. The Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, predated the Civil War is the oldest unit in the university. Other early colleges were the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Columbian College of Dentistry. These Chicago-based health colleges became fully incorporated in 1913 as the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy. The College of Pharmacy was the first pharmacy school west of the Alleghenies and emphasized laboratory instruction and research. Dentistry became the first American dental school fully equipped with electric drills. The College of Medicine developed the country’s first occupational therapy program and grew rapidly to become the largest medical school in the U.S. In the decades following incorporation , several other health science colleges were created. Together with the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy , they formed the Chicago Professional Colleges of the University of Illinois. In 1961, the professional colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center. 1945 to 65: Navy Pier years Following World War II, the University of Illinois increased its presence in Chicago by creating a temporary, two-year branch campus on Navy Pier. The Chicago Undergraduate Division primarily accommodated student veterans on the G.I. Bill. The program allowed all students to complete their first two years of study in Chicago before going downstate to finish their undergraduate degrees at Urbana-Champaign. The lakeside location earned the Navy Pier campus the name “Harvard on the rocks.” The university shared the 3,000-foot pier with other tenants that included the Chicago Police Department Traffic Division and several military detachments. At that time Navy Pier was not the bright, attractive venue it is today as Chicago’s leading tourist attraction. The pier was a dreary, functioning port facility. But because the pier had only a single corridor along its half-mile length, students were able to see their peers each day. Richard J. Daley Richard J. Daley envisioned and established a public university for the city of Chicago. UIC’s Richard J. Daley Library holds the late mayor’s personal and family archive and political papers of two other Chicago mayors. More about Daley's role in establishing UIC 1965 to 81: University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UICC) After the war, and after the wave of returning veterans seeking education benefits under the G.I. Bill had passed through, demand for a public university in Chicago remained high. The university made plans to create a permanent, degree-granting campus in the Chicago area. The site was a 100-acre parcel at the junction of Greektown and Little Italy. To accommodate a planned student body of 32,000 in such a small area, famed Chicago architect Walter Netsch arrayed the campus buildings in concentric rings, like a droplet of water. The University of Illinois at Chicago Circle – named for the nearby ultra-modern freeway interchange – opened in February 1965. “Circle,” as it was called, was a degree-granting institution, with ambitions to become a great university. A member of the faculty proudly noted it was the first university to be named for a transportation feature since Oxford and Cambridge. Within five years of the campus’s opening – a period during which it was the fastest growing campus in the country – enrollment grew from 5,000 to 18,000 and almost every department offered graduate degrees. Befitting the location of the campus at a crossroads of immigration, many of Circle’s students were first in their families to attend college – as are many of UIC’s students today. Stanley Ikenberry Despite opposition fears that a merger would harm Circle’s urban mission or the reputations of the medical faculty, former university president Stanley Ikenberry signaled his support for unifying the Medical Center and Circle campuses by walking from one to the other. The new UIC was created in 1982 and within five years had attained Carnegie “Research I” classification. More about the creation of UIC 1982 and on: University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) UIC was born in 1982, when the Circle and Medical Center campuses consolidated to form a comprehensive university campus with six health science colleges and an academic medical center. Consolidation helped UIC reach elite Carnegie “Research I” status. In 1993, then-UIC Chancellor (and later UI President) James Stukel launched the Great Cities Initiative to join UIC teaching and research with community, corporate and government partners in tackling urban challenges. Renamed the Great Cities Commitment at it’s ten-year mark, the signature program integrates research with genuine community engagement. In the 2000s, UIC’s South Campus development brought student housing, retail stores, restaurants and private residences to the historic Maxwell Street neighborhood. The influx of faculty and staff families and the expansion of student housing helped UIC change from a daytime commuter campus into a vibrant, 24-hour academic community. Today, one-third of UIC freshmen and about one-fifth of undergraduates live on campus. In July 2019, UIC opened its newest campus living facility. The 10-story Academic and Residential Complex , which is part of a public-private partnership, holds 550 beds in a mix of traditional dorm rooms and suite-style units. Three large lecture halls, four classrooms, several small group study rooms, a tutoring center, computer stations and collaboration spaces are highlights of the facility’s academic areas. The Engineering Innovation Building , which also opened in July 2019, is the first new academic building on the east side of campus since 1991. The 50,000-square-foot facility houses instructional space, research labs and faculty and staff offices. The building also includes the University’s first high-bay structural research lab, where researchers can carry out a wide range of tests on large-scale structural components. Additional new campus construction projects are underway to support scholarship and research and improve the student experience. In August 2019, UIC acquired the John Marshall Law School and formed Chicago’s only public law school. Formerly an independent private school, John Marshall was founded in 1899 and for over a century upheld a tradition of diversity, innovation and opportunity and provided an education that combines an understanding of the theory, the philosophy and the practice of law. The creation of UIC John Marshall Law School provides current and prospective law students with more affordable education, as well as enhanced student services, such as access to health care, recreational facilities, residence halls and college athletics. There will be opportunities to take interdisciplinary courses, and new joint-degree and dual-degree programs are in development. These courses and programs align with UIC’s strengths in disciplines such as the health sciences, engineering and technology, urban planning and public administration, the social sciences and business. UIC mascots Navy Pier’s athletic teams were known as the “Chi-Illini.” The move to Circle campus brought a new identity as the “Chikas” in homage to the Chikasaw nation. When UIC was created, students selected the “Flames” as team name, recalling the 1871 Chicago fire. Mascot Sparky D. Dragon has fired up fans for more than 20 years.

Photo: Joshua Clark. University of Illinois at Chicago senior Anis Barmada is one of 49 international students to win the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship for graduate studies at the University of Cambridge. Barmada, a UIC Honors College member majoring in biological sciences and chemistry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, was selected in the highly competitive selection process, which emphasizes outstanding academic achievement and social leadership. The newly elected international cohort joins more than two dozen scholars from the U.S., who were announced in February, to complete the Gates Cambridge class of 2020. The
prestigious scholarship, which aims to build a global network of future leaders
committed to improving the lives of others, is funded by the Gates Cambridge
Trust established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Barmada, who grew up in Damascus,
Syria, and immigrated to the U.S. in 2015, will
pursue a master’s degree in genomic medicine in the department of
medical genetics in the School of Clinical Medicine at Cambridge. “I hope to visualize the molecular, analytical, statistical, social and clinical challenges facing the use of omics-based personalized medicine across everyday clinics,” he said. “Professionally, I intend to pursue an MD/Ph.D. advancing biochemical and computational technologies to address currently incurable diseases and contributing to the crafting of a new era of health care without disparities.” Barmada, who
is minoring in mathematics, is part of the President’s Award Program STEM
Initiative at UIC, which is a selective peer and faculty network for students
in STEM disciplines to do research, develop professional connections and
prepare for graduate education. Since his first year at UIC, he
has conducted research on diabetic eye disease in the laboratory of Scott
Shippy, UIC associate professor of chemistry and bioengineering, while also
volunteering at an ophthalmology clinic that serves patients of the same
life-changing, blindness-causing disease conditions. “Through
these experiences, I found an articulation of my interests in patient-driven
research that considers both the biochemical and socioeconomic lenses,” he
said. Shippy considers Barmada “nothing short of remarkable” and, as an example, noted his key role in the lab’s project to collect tears from mice to look for markers of disease that resulted in two first-author publications from the young researcher. “He has grown tremendously from those first days learning the basic lab techniques to the present day with a research-oriented opinion article under review in an ophthalmology journal,” Shippy said. “With his intellect and astounding work ethic, I predict he will have a large impact on the future of health care as a scientist-physician.” The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is the latest honor for Barmada, who earned a prestigious Goldwater scholarship in 2019 and was among the U.S. finalists for a 2020 Rhodes Scholarship. He is the recipient of several scholarships and awards, in addition to research support via Honors College research grants, the Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Initiative and the chemistry department’s Herbert E. Paaren Summer Research Stipend. Barmada, a resident of Mount Prospect and 2016 graduate of Wheeling High School, is the fifth UIC student to win a Gates Cambridge Scholarship since the program was established through a $210 million donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. UIC’s Office of External Fellowships provides advising and assistance
to current undergraduate and professional school students in finding and
applying for a range of nationally and internationally competitive fellowships,
scholarships and grants.

(Photo credit: Joshua Clark) University of Illinois at Chicago acting student Richard Cantu didn’t hesitate as members of the five-time Grammy-winning Ladysmith Black Mambazo called audience members onto the UIC Theatre stage to join them to sing and take part in learning Zulu dances. The internationally known South African group was at UIC on Monday to offer a nearly two-hour master class to Cantu and other music and theatre students. “They were amazing; I thought they were incredibly talented, and it was very gracious for them to come and share their gift with us,” said Cantu, a third-year student who joined other UIC students on stage. “The way they incorporated the audience was a lot of fun. Anytime I get the chance to go up and perform in front of people is a great opportunity.” The eight-member group, made up of several sons of the ensemble’s founder, Joseph Shabalala, explained how their father came up with the idea in the early 1960s to form the group from a dream. The music, known as “Isicathamiya,” has its roots in the music developed by Zulu migrant workers in South African mines. Isicathamiya music often is made up of mostly basses, several tenors and a lead vocalist, without any female voices, as the workers in the mines traditionally were men who used music to express their longing for their homes and families, said Sibongiseni Shabalala, a group member and one of the founder’s sons. “When they started to sing, they discovered that because there were no women there, there were no children, they missed the small voices of their sisters and mothers,” Sibongiseni said. “That is when the Isicathamiya music started…they tried to imitate the voices of the women. It’s not complete until they do the Zulu dance.” The name “Ladysmith” comes from the South African town where the founder was born and raised. Sibongiseni, along with his brother, Thulani, used the opportunity to teach the 85 people in the audience Zulu words used in their traditional songs as well as dance steps, and they shared how the music was born during the era of Apartheid as a way for his father to help black South Africans. Among the difficulties the group had in the early days was
traveling through the country, as black men were barred from being in groups.
The lyrics also could not be explicit to avoid incurring the wrath of the white
government before Apartheid ended. “At that time in South Africa, it was difficult as a black person to live in South Africa. He was trying to promote peace and to give hope to black people that one day things would be all right,” Thulani said of his father. The group became international stars when American singer and songwriter Paul Simon collaborated with the group for his award-winning album, “Graceland,” in 1986. The group also has collaborated and recorded with other icons of American pop music, including Stevie Wonder, Dolly Parton, Sarah McLachlan, Josh Groban, Emmylou Harris, Michael Jackson and Melissa Etheridge. Thulani Shabalala of Ladysmith Black Mambazo performs. (Photo Credit: Joshua Clark) The group is in Chicago until January taking part in Steppenwolf
Theatre’s production of “Lindiwe,” written and co-directed by Eric Simonson,
which features Yasen
Peyankov , UIC’s head of theatre. Peyankov, who is also a UIC associate
professor and a Steppenwolf Theatre featured ensemble member, invited the
ensemble to UIC as a way to give students an opportunity to learn from the
group. After working with the ensemble, Peyankov said he felt that the students in the music and acting tracks could learn from the group, which incorporates music, dance and acting in performances. “Their performances are, in a way, performances on their own; they use voice, but they also use dance, so I felt like this fit the bill for the theatre and music departments,” Peyankov said.  “I hope they [students] learned something about the group, the culture and how you can work as an ensemble in a group of collaborators.” Christian Ortega, a third-year acting student, said he was impressed with how the group was able to develop and how the music was passed down from the founder to his children and others who are continuing the musical legacy. “Hearing how it all started from their dad and how they wanted to replicate the sounds of their wives and sisters from home relates so much to me,” Ortega said. Zac Boehm, a senior in music, said he felt honored that the group chose to share their culture and the background with UIC. He said he loved how interactive the class was and that the group managed to include the audience in their songs and music so “we were part of that for a little bit.” “Honestly, it was more of a spiritual experience for me,” Boehm said.

Photo:  Yanxiao Han and Petr Král SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic,
infects cells by using its spike proteins to attach to proteins present on the
surfaces of certain human cells, also known as ACE2 receptors. Upon binding to
ACE2, the virus fuses with the host cell membrane and gains entry via this
attachment. Finding inhibitors that block key regions of the spike protein and
keep the virus from infecting cells is the focus of many scientists from around
world. At the University of Illinois at Chicago, researchers recently published a study in the journal ACS Nano that details findings from computer simulations seeking to identify these inhibitors, which eventually could assist chemists to develop new medicines to combat the coronavirus. Using a recently published X-ray crystal structure of the
receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 when it is bound to ACE2, the researchers
were able to identify 15 amino acids from ACE2 that interact directly with the
viral spike protein. Yanxiao Han, a UIC Ph.D. student in chemistry and first author on the paper, and Petr Král, UIC professor of chemistry, physics, biopharmaceutical sciences and chemical engineering, used computer modeling to design and assess four peptides that mimic the virus-binding domain of the human protein that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. Their molecular dynamics simulations revealed a double alpha helix
extracted from ACE2 as a highly stable peptide and potential defender from the
virus, capable of blocking the spike proteins. “A single alpha helix was not particularly stable,” said Král, senior author of the study. “So, the discovery that a pair of linked self-supporting helices can provide strong and stable binding was very exciting.” Han and Král hope that simple peptides might do the job of
healing the patients in later stages by slowing down the activity of the virus. “Such peptides might have limited secondary impact on the
organisms,” Král said. “These are not vaccines but possible therapeutics for
inhalation.” The peptides still need to be tested in the lab and in patients, but being able to narrow down drug candidates on the computer could help advance this process, according to the researchers. Han’s work related to the study is supported through the UIC
Graduate College Dean’s Scholar Fellowship.

"UIC’s Lydia Diamond wins Horton Foote Playwriting Award | UIC Today Skip to main content Updated: Apr 24, 2020 at 05:12 PM UIC Logo Today Submit Campus News Academics & Research Events Resources Current Student Resources Faculty & Staff Resources Photography/Video Social Media Account Request Form UIC Social Media Guidelines and Best Practices COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions What you need to know about COVID-19 Support for the UIC community (COVID-19) Teaching, learning and working resources In the News: COVID-19 Contact Communicating On Campus Sending Announcements / DDDH UIC Social Media Directory UIC’s Lydia Diamond wins Horton Foote Playwriting Award April 22, 2020 Lydia Diamond, playwright and UIC clinical associate professor of theatre. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Lydia Diamond grew up moving frequently as her single mother’s musical and academic teaching career took her from one university to another. During this time, her mother also earned advanced degrees and taught future artists. Diamond came from a family of musicians and educators, so she had been required to take violin lessons from the time she was 6. In high school, she managed to convince her mother to let her put down the violin in favor of letting the theatre be her mode of artistic expression. After earning an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University and spending a decade performing professionally, she realized that her true calling was as a playwright. Diamond, UIC clinical associate professor of theatre in the School of Theatre and Music within the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, was recently named the recipient of the 2020 Horton Foote Playwriting Award. The award comes with a $25,000 prize that will be awarded in July. She has nine published plays including her latest work, “Toni Stone,” which was critically acclaimed, and named Critic’s Pick by the New York Times.  In addition to “Toni Stone,” her plays include “Smart People,” “Stick Fly,” “Harriet Jacobs,” “Voyeurs de Venus,” “The Gift Horse,” “The Inside,” and her adaptation of Toni Morrison’s novel, “The Bluest Eye.” She also has written for television. She recently spoke about her life and career and how UIC helps inform her writing. Tell us how you feel about winning the Horton Foote award? It’s so exciting, I don’t win a lot of awards so when I saw, “Congratulations” on the subject line of an email I thought, “Oh right, it’ll be something like, ‘Congratulations you have won an opportunity to buy a book,’ or some such. Then I opened it and it was real… and I kept reading, the news got better and better. I was teaching a class in about five minutes, and so after my mom and my boyfriend, the first people who knew were my UIC students. I lived in Texas when I was in high school, so I have an affection for Horton Foote in general and am a great admirer of his work. To receive an award in his name is a great honor. How did you get into playwriting and how many plays have you written? I’ve written about 12 plays, nine of them have been published and are produced regularly. I started playwriting in college. I went to Northwestern and was one of only two theatre majors of color at the time. There just weren’t many roles available to me, so I started writing my own material, writing one-woman shows and plays. At that time in Chicago (I think it’s not so different now), you could find a space in which to produce a show, call yourself a theatre company, send out a press release, and reviewers would actually come and review the work.  I worked in this place, Café Voltaire, where I was a cook, a waitress, a hostess and the manager of this little theater space in the basement.  That’s where I produced my first shows. Ironically that’s where, over two decades ago, I first met Yasen Peyankov, head of UIC’s Theater Department. He was directing a production of “Macbeth” there. Roundabout Theatre Company’s “Toni Stone.” (Photo: Joan Marcus) What are the themes that you go back to and why? Most of my work deals with themes of class, race and gender. I think it’s because I have always written about the things that are hard for us to talk about; things that confound and/or disgust or continue to shock me. I’m an African American woman, and I move through a world that has a relationship with African American people that is deeply problematic. I’m always amazed at how hard it is for all of us — people of all races — to talk about these things. I work out my questions and I work out trying to figure it out in my plays. It doesn’t mean that I’m writing political plays that are didactic and only about that. I’m writing plays that are about families and I’m writing plays about interesting historical figures and I’m writing plays about contemporary people of various ethnicities, sexual orientations, and classes. People who look like the folks I interact with daily. If you are a person of color, this is the world you are navigating. So, those themes are always going to come up in my work. Which is the latest play that is being produced and how does it fit into your overall anthology? It is “Toni Stone.” It took four years to write and is the true story about the first woman of any race to play in a professional baseball game when she played with the Indianapolis Clowns of the professional Negro Leagues. It started at the Roundabout Theater in New York. The American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco just put up its second production, also directed by Pam MacKinnon. Sadly, because of COVID-19, it closed the day after its opening. What’s great is that they’ve taped it and are making tickets for patrons to purchase and view online. It’s slated to be done at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., if we’re back to business as usual by July. I’ve just heard that there are about 10 productions of it around the country for the following season. The New York production of ‘Toni Stone’ garnered very good reviews. How does that make you feel? Throughout my career, my New York reviews were often not as flattering as the ones from other cities around the country. This is my first experience with critical raves in New York. It’s so very exciting, but I was also astounded and concerned because I didn’t realize how much of an impact it would have on the success of the play in every way. The industry needs to look at the ecology of the American theatre, which puts so much emphasis on the opinions of one or two reviewers in New York, to be the arbiters of what happens to the future of that play. They have the power to affect the number of future productions that a play might have, and its financial viability in general. So, yes, it felt wonderful to get raves across the board, AND, yes, it is all very arbitrary and a bit like winning the lottery when it happens. April Mathis in Roundabout Theatre Company’s production of “Toni Stone.” (Photo: Joan Marcus) Since you were a theater major as an undergrad, are you still an actor? Good God no! No, no, no. I’m not. It just took me a long time to realize that. I majored in acting and you spend a lot of time convincing your family that you’ll be OK. I learned now, as I’ve gotten older, I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and my brain doesn’t want to hold on to lines. I seriously struggled my whole acting career to just learn my lines, which means I never really got to act because I couldn’t fully immerse myself in the character; so much of my attention went to trying to remember my lines. Though I was working steadily, I was miserable and expecting to be fired. It was awful. My then-husband was like, “It doesn’t seem like you like acting.” And I thought, ‘Oh, wow, that’s true. I don’t have to do this.’ By that time, my playwriting career had taken off. It was just a matter of saying to myself and then to people, ‘I’m a playwright.’ As opposed to saying, ‘I’m an actor, and I write plays.’ It was very liberating. What do you teach at UIC and what words of advice can you give students about writing for theater? I teach Playwriting, Script Analysis, a class called Contemporary Performance Techniques, in which people create their own work and we put on a show at the end of the semester. I tell my students to just write. Write as much as they can, all the time without judging themselves and their writing. I think it’s important that you don’t turn to other people for affirmation about what you do and how you do it (another issue I have with the reality of reviews). You write because you have stories to tell that are interesting but we have a tendency to think, ‘I’m not really a playwright unless I have a show at the Goodman Theatre, or I’m not really a playwright unless I have a show on Broadway.’ It took me 22 years of a successful playwriting career before I had a show on Broadway. If you think you’re writing so you can have certain kinds of accolades, you’ll lose your mind. There are too few opportunities and too many people who are good artists, for us to let the opinions of others dictate our artistic viability. Sure, you send a play out to theatres in hopes that it will be produced one day, but in the meantime, you must make a way for yourself. You write the play, then you find a church, or the basement of a vegetarian restaurant, or the back of a bar, recruit some of your friends, invite people to see it, and that’s being successful in the theater. How has UIC helped you achieve your goals and your dreams? Our students inspire me daily. I love them! They have incredible work ethics and a great deal of talent. Refreshingly, our students are lacking in something that I have seen at universities that cater to more economically privileged students. Our students tend not to indulge in ‘Am I talented enough?’ neurosis. They’re like, ‘I’m here to learn, and I’m working very hard to be here. Teach me.’ The prevailing attitude is: ‘Let’s go, let’s do this,’ and that is inspiring to me. Also, UIC is the first place I’ve ever worked where the students are wonderfully diverse, especially racially. I think that’s such a gift to the students and bodes well for our institution. They will leave UIC with a certain cultural fluency, a privilege that a lot of people just don’t have.

UIC photo. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Special Collections and University Archives is launching a project to collect stories, photos, artwork and other current materials from the university community to document how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting life at UIC. The effort, dubbed Six Feet Apart: Stories from UIC during COVID-19, is a way to document history in the making as the world, the nation, municipalities and college institutions, including UIC, attempt to cope with this pandemic. As with past pandemics, the records created by these entities will be studied in the future. The University Library’s Special Collections and University Archives, the UIC Humanities in Medicine (HuMed) student group and the UIC College of Medicine are leading the effort to collect documentation that could aid future historians. This is important as journalists, bloggers and scholars have relied on historical documentation from the 1918 flu epidemic to garner lessons that help us in the present, said Megan Keller Young, special collections librarian. “This project is a way to capture personal reflections, which are all too often missing from the historical record,” said Keller Young. “This is a historical event all of us are going through together, but no one in quite the same way. All of these experiences should be documented for future researchers.” The organizers are asking current UIC students, faculty and staff to share their stories and experiences of how their lives have been impacted by COVID-19. The submissions will be preserved in the University Library’s Special Collections and University Archives, where they will be publicly available to students, researchers and other visitors to the library. Submissions can be written accounts, videos, photos and more. Selected materials eventually will be included in a digital exhibit chronicling the current pandemic. It’s important to document how quickly and dramatically everything has changed in a “blink of the eye,” said UIC medical student Chioma Ndukwe, one of the leaders of the History/Ethics subcommittee for HuMed. She said the humanities have always served to document the “how and why” of history. “Everyone has been working hard during this crisis — health care workers, IT techs, professors, students, maintenance workers and many more,” Ndukwe said. “I wanted those efforts to be documented; that way people years or even decades in the future can look back and learn from and about our experiences today.” UIC students, staff, and faculty are being asked to provide details on their day-to-day lives such as how they are coping with the transition to online learning, how graduating students are impacted by the pandemic in their final year, how their future employment prospects are also affected and the challenges of working from home. The project organizers especially hope to collect the experiences of those working in the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System. To submit their stories and experiences, UIC students, staff and faculty should use the submission form where they may contribute as much detail about themselves as they wish. Though they must provide an email address in case they need to be contacted by library staff, submissions can be anonymized when added to the collection. To learn more about the project and submitting, visit the project page .

While we wish we could come together physically for a day of activism and action, we nevertheless hope to see you join us (virtually) in support of a Plastic-Free UIC. In honor of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we want the UIC community — wherever you are —  to participate in this year’s virtual Earth Day events throughout the month of April. Please join your fellow UIC students, faculty, and staff in our virtual “clean up” via the Litterati app, and develop a zero-waste policy for your department, unit, student organization or residence hall. While sharing your support for a plastic-free university on social media, we also encourage you to wear red instead of green. Besides showing some UIC-colored pride for the Zero Waste accomplishments we’ve made so far, we’re sounding the alarm on the climate crisis. Share your support for a Plastic-Free UIC. We hope you’ll join us in virtual support of a healthier, safer, and more sustainable planet. Please visit our Earth Day webpage for more information .

Further, federal regulations require institutions of higher education to disclose information for filing complaints. The information below is intended to provide both institutional and external contact information to current and prospective students. Academic Concerns Students are encouraged to contact their college office to seek advice. The Student Handbook , the undergraduate catalog , and the graduate catalog provide guidance on campus-level policy. If complaints cannot be resolved at the college level or with the help of Student Ombuds Service (see below), the formal mechanism to register student complaints is through the Student Academic Grievance Procedures . They define an administrative process through which students may seek resolution of complaints or grievances regarding academic standing during their enrollment at UIC. Examples of complaints addressed by this process include but are not limited to grade disputes and program dismissals. Note that these procedures may not be used for decisions made as a result of the Student Conduct Process, described below. Other Complaints If a complaint cannot be resolved within the college or the student prefers to speak to someone outside of the college, students have access to several services within the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS). The Student Ombuds Service within the Office of the Dean of Students provides an impartial advocate for fairness who investigates student complaints. The Ombudsperson may serve as a counselor, go-between, mediator, or informal fact finder. Some of the matters which may be addressed by this service include grade disputes / grievance procedures, student record errors, billing / financial issues and registration problems. The Student Conduct Process within the Office of the Dean of Students is also available to any student, university employee, or community member with a complaint about a UIC student. They can file a student misconduct incident report or academic integrity incident report form regarding possible violations of the University Standards of Conduct, which is included in the Student Disciplinary Policy . The Office for Access and Equity strives to increase access to employment, programs, and services in an environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment. As part of the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) is the office charged with reviewing and addressing complaints of harassment and/or discrimination. This includes sex discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment and retaliation. Students may file a complaint internally using the established reporting process on the OAE website . UIC is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, services, and all activities at UIC. Students with complaints or concerns about accessibility issues on campus can submit an Online Report of UIC Accessibility Issues available at the UIC Disability Resources website . The Disability Resource Center (DRC) receives these reports and follows up with different units on campus based on the nature of the complaint. If the student experiences discrimination based on disability it should be reported directly to the Office of Access and Equity (OAE). External Resources If a student's complaint cannot be resolved by the University, a complaint may be filed with the Illinois Board of Higher Education , which regulates higher education institutions in Illinois, through their Complaint System ; or the student may contact the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) , UIC's regional accrediting agency, through their Complaint Process . Online Education Complaint Resolution Students enrolled in Online or Distance Education courses are encouraged to contact their respective college office to seek advice. Since the University of Illinois at Chicago has been approved as an institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) initiative by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA), students enrolled from participating SARA states, as indicated by the State Authorization webpage , follow the SARA Complaint Resolution Process . Such students may contact the Illinois Board of Higher Education (the Illinois SARA portal agency) with complaints that were not resolved through the student campus complaint procedures described above by accessing the IBHE online complaint system . Students enrolled in programs in states outside of SARA contact their own state agencies with complaints that were not resolved through the student UIC campus complaint procedures described above. Online students with questions about complaint procedures may also contact UIC Extended Campus at onlineinfo@uic.edu or at (312) 355-0423 .

Introduction About Us The Black Tech Scholars Program started from an honest dialogue regarding racial and gender disparities in the technology sector that later cultivated into a full fledged partnership between private and public entities committed to providing young people of color with the opportunity to acquire transferable professional development skills and gain hands-on experiential learning opportunities. Our goal is to provide opportunities for African American students to learn technical and professional skills that will give them the tools they need to pursue careers in the modern workplace. By providing these opportunities for our scholars, we can change the landscape of the tech workforce demographic and create a more inclusive environment. We continue to find ways to assist our scholars experience in their pursuits to gain relevant technical skills that can eventually prepare them for careers within the tech industry. In addition to the weekly courses, our scholars have an opportunity to engage in the following activities: • Connect directly with professionals in the field to build their networks and obtain mentorship • Actively participate in design sprint-like events (Hack-a-thon) in which computer programmers and others involved in software development collaborate intensively on software projects • Complete a culminating project in which scholars design and develop websites for local community organizations • Attend career fairs, networking events and forums in order to research career possibilities, network with prospective employers, make and obtain a first impression with potential employers and clients.",https://bts.uic.edu/,AAAN Black Tech Scholars Program | University of Illinois at Chicago

UIC prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC will take prompt and fair action to eliminate such conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects through interim protective measures and accommodations, equitable investigations, and disciplinary processes. Employees and students in violation of this policy may face sanctions up to and including termination or expulsion. The Office for Access and Equity, through its Title IX Coordinator, has the authority to conduct investigations, to determine when there have been violations of this policy based on the standard of preponderance of evidence, and then make recommendations in accordance with the relevant University policies for students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC encourages good faith reports of Sexual Misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any person who reports Sexual Misconduct and/or who participates in a Title IX investigation or resultant disciplinary process. All employees are considered to be “Responsible Employees” with the authority and responsibility to report Sexual Misconduct to University Officials.  Employees who are exempted from this reporting requirement are professional or pastoral counselors who provide work-related mental-health counseling, campus advocates who provide confidential victim assistance, and employees who are otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing information received in the course of providing professional care and treatment. Reason for Policy : To ensure that UIC is compliant with federal and state laws related to sex discrimination, which includes sexual violence, Sexual Misconduct, and sexual and gender-based harassment. This policy updates the existing policy to mandate that the University’s faculty and staff report incidents involving Sexual Misconduct to the Title IX coordinator. Minority Impact Statement: The policy does not have any disproportionate or unique impact on UIC’s minority students, staff, or faculty. Who Should Read the Policy: All students, faculty, staff, and administrators at UIC. Definitions : Sexual Misconduct : According to federal Title IX regulations, unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex includes: (a) sexual harassment, (b) gender-based harassment, which is unwelcome conduct based on actual or perceived sex, or harassment based on gender identity or nonconformity with sex stereotypes, and/or (c) all forms of sexual violence including, but not limited to, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, sexual coercion, sexual exploitation, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking (collectively referred to as “Sexual Misconduct”). Sexual misconduct is the term used in this policy to encompass unwanted or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is committed without valid consent. Also included in this term is any abusive behavior that arises out of an actual or perceived intimate relationship (e.g. domestic or dating violence and stalking). Sexual misconduct may occur between people of the same gender or different gender identifications. University : Refers to UIC. Procedures : Procedures, reporting options, and resources are outlined on the UIC Office for Access and Equity Website . Students may review the Student Sexual Misconduct website . Related Laws, Regulations, Statutes, and Policies: Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (“Title IX”), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended (“Title VII”), 2013 VAWA amendments to the Clery Act, the Clery Act, the Illinois Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education Act, the Illinois Human Rights Act, and related UIC and University of Illinois System policies.",https://oae.uic.edu/policies/sexual-misconduct-policy/,"Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct | Office for Access and Equity | University of Illinois at Chicago"

For example, first-year students must maintain a 3.2 GPA in their first year at UIC and completing the Freshmen Engineering Success Program, a series of workshops and group projects that introduce you to your chosen major and teach you how to make the most of your existing math and science skills. The Guaranteed Paid Internship Program, or GPIP, as it is known, places students in paid positions in one of 42 UIC research labs and in other university departments. Students find out at the end of their first year whether they have qualified for the program and, if so, what their internship experience will be. Students describe GPIP as a significant force in accelerating their trajectory into future internships after their sophomore and junior years. The program reflects UIC Engineering’s commitment to helping our students lay the best possible groundwork for post-graduation career success. quote 1 My first internship through GPIP was in research, and the experience prepared me well for approaching new projects and positions. I knew very little about the work required for the assignment coming in, but I learned that you don’t need to know everything to be able to contribute to a project.

You can actually get jaded. You can stop seeing things that are new. You can start fearing failure. Those are the things an entrepreneur needs—an open mind and the ability to see the world with new eyes.” – Caterina Fake , Co-Founder of Flickr and Hunch Women in Computer Science WiCS works hard to continue to hold events throughout the academic school year. We continue to co-sponsor the Fall Annual Scavenger Hunt as well as: hosting Alumni guest speakers, tech talks, Inside Scoop, etc. We greatly appreciate all the people who come to support us and learn more about us. We would love to host an event with recruiters, Alumni, professors, professionals, etc!

The Department of Computer Science degree requirements are outlined below. Students should consult the College of Engineering section for additional degree requirements and college academic policies. The Joint Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) and Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) is designed for undergraduate students with outstanding academic performance who desire to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science, or who wish to prepare themselves for advanced placement in the workplace. Students will earn both a BSCS and an MSCS degree upon completion, with 8 hours of course work shared between the two degrees. The requirements for completion of the combined BSCS/MSCS degree are identical to the completion of these two separate degrees; however, there are 8 hours of shared course work used for both degrees. Completion of 120 hours at the undergraduate level; plus 8 shared hours counting toward both the BSCS and MSCS degrees; plus 28 hours of course work at the graduate level will result in joint BSCS/MSCS degrees. Students in the BSCS who have only two semesters of course work left and who have at least a 3.60/4.00 grade point average may register for two graduate-level courses (one at the 400 level, and one at the 500 level) and receive 4 hours, instead of 3 hours, for each. The graduate-level courses taken in the senior year will be used at the undergraduate level to fulfill 8 hours of BS selective requirements. At the graduate level these courses will count as required courses. An advisor must approve these courses. Students should apply to the program during their third year, after having completed at least 27 credit hours of CS courses (excluding CS 398 ). An overall GPA of 3.60 or higher is required for application.

All PhD students must pass the qualifier examination before the end of their fourth semester of enrollment; the actual completion date is approximately halfway through the fourth semester. The qualifier examination consists of three parts: PhD course requirement: Designed to evaluate basic proficiency in core areas of computer science. This requirement must be completed by the end of the third semester. Written critique and presentation: Tests analytic and presentation skills in a particular area of computer science. This requirement must be completed in the third or fourth semester. Final evaluation: Provides a faculty evaluation of performance in the first two parts of the examination. This is done in the middle of the fourth semester. qualifier PhD Course Requirement To complete this requirement of the qualifier exam, students must show competency in CS 401 and in three additional classes from a pre-approved list by either enrolling in the course and performing up to standard or by taking the in-class comprehensive final exam. Students must earn at least a “B” in all four courses and a minimum of two “A’s” from among the four.  This course requirement must be met by the end of the third semester in the program.  Students may choose not to enroll in a course and instead take the final examination to meet the course requirement. If students choose this option, the course instructor should be notified of the student’s intent at the beginning of the semester, and the student must take the final exam at the regularly scheduled time for other students enrolled in the course that semester.  Any 400-level or 500-level computer science course that has an in-class comprehensive final exam, along with a comprehensive syllabus available at the beginning of the course, is eligible. Courses that fulfill this requirement are: CS 401 (with CS instructor), CS 411, CS 412, CS 421, CS 422, CS 440, CS 441, CS 442, CS 450, CS 461, CS 466, CS 473, CS 474, CS 476, CS 478, CS 480, CS 487, CS 488, CS 511, CS 512, CS 553, CS 581, CS 583, and CS 586. If the class is not on this list, students may petition for a substitution. The petition must be submitted at least two weeks prior to the start of the semester.  Note for PhD students who completed their master’s or undergraduate study at UIC: Students who received an MS in computer science at UIC may petition to use courses from the approved list to satisfy the qualifier exam course requirement, provided the courses in question were taken within the last five years. CS 401 must have been completed with a CS instructor. On the other hand, students who received a BS degree from the computer science department at UIC may not use any coursework done as an undergraduate to satisfy the qualifier course requirement. They may choose to take other courses on the list or take the final exam of a course they have already completed.

They may choose to take other courses on the list or take the final exam of a course they have already completed. Written Critique and Presentation Written Critique and Presentation The written critique and presentation (hereafter, WCP) allows students to demonstrate their ability to analyze, evaluate, and present an existing body of research. This research is usually, but not necessarily, in the area in which they plan to do their dissertation work. The WCP should be completed in the student’s second year in the program. The target completion date is about halfway through the fourth semester). The WCP consists of two deliverables: Critical review: a significant piece of scholarly expository writing based on the selection of two to four papers from the research literature in the chosen area. The critical review typically ranges from 15 to 25 pages, assuming that 7,000 words results in 20 pages. Presentation: 45-minute oral presentation followed by questions from faculty The WCP is evaluated by a three-person committee: a designated WCP chair (who must be someone other than the faculty advisor) and two other members. The student identifies a topic and selects a chair for the WCP who agrees to administer the exam. The chair cannot be the student’s faculty advisor. The chair chooses the two to four technical papers that will be critiqued. The second member of the committee can be (but does not have to be) the student’s advisor. Student nominations are welcome for the third member of the committee; students may submit two to three names of the third committee member they would prefer, but the final decision is up to the director of graduate studies. Students must write a short proposal naming their desired committee members, describing the area of research, and listing the papers that will be included in the critical review. This proposal must be submitted to the director of graduate studies, via the Student Affairs office in 905 SEO, for consideration and approval. A turnaround time for approval of at least one week should be anticipated. Students should use the WCP Committee Form for this proposal. The director of graduate studies will finalize and approve the committee. From the date of this approval, the student has exactly 60 days to prepare the critical review. During this 60-day examination period, the student may ask the faculty, including the WCP committee members, specific questions about the selected work, but faculty members should not assist in analyzing the content, significance, or accuracy of the selected work. Copies of the finished critical review should be delivered to each committee member on or before the end of the 60-day period. The presentation component of the WCP should be held within three weeks—but not less than one week—after the critical review is handed in. Scheduling the presentation is the student’s responsibility and should be handled in advance of when the critical review is handed in. For the presentation, the candidate is expected to deliver the content of the critical review as though presenting a technical paper at a conference. Visual aids and other relevant materials are expected, and the evaluation is based on technical sharpness, presentation style, command of the area, and effectiveness of visual aids. The presentation should be roughly 45 minutes in length. Note: Fluency in English is optimal, but the most important criteria will relate to the candidate’s ability to get the material across to the audience. Presentations are open to the general public and followed by a question-and-answer period covering both the critical review and the general research area. The WCP committee may elect to continue with a closed-door question-and-answer period followed by a discussion. As with all talks and in-person presentations in the computer science department, a WCP presentation announcement—including an abstract, names of the committee members, time, date, and location—should be sent to the Student Affairs office (905 SEO) at least a week before the event for inclusion in faculty and graduate-student email lists. The WCP is graded with a numerical score from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the best performance. The committee also provides a short evaluation of the student’s performance. The WCP cannot be repeated. In cases where the WCP topic falls in the student’s main research area, there may be substantial overlap between the written critique and the Related Work section of the dissertation proposal and/or the dissertation itself. This is acceptable. A conference paper, master’s thesis, or other similar document cannot simply be submitted verbatim as a substitute for the WCP. However, parts of prior written work on which the student is the sole author may be re-used as the basis for part or all of a WCP paper. Details should be negotiated between the student and the WCP committee chair. Success or Failure on Qualifier Examination Success or Failure on Qualifier Examination If a student is deemed to have passed the qualifier exam, he or she proceeds forward in the course of study toward the PhD in computer science. If a student is deemed to have failed the qualifier exam, the student must leave the program. The decision of the faculty on the qualifier examination is final; there is no petitioning of the decision.

Qualified applicants are offered guaranteed multi-year funding. The department’s graduate committee continuously reviews the record and progress of every graduate student, and appointments to all forms of financial assistance are conditional on satisfactory academic and job specific performance. Graduate student funding Forms of funding include: Teaching assistants Research assistants Fellowships Tuition and fee waivers Teaching assistants Teaching assistants typically support faculty members who are teaching large-enrollment courses. Teaching assistants may handle laboratory and discussion sections and/or grade papers. The department determines the number of teaching assistantships that will be available, based on instructional needs and other priorities, and assigns students to these roles. The work of each teaching assistant is then determined by his or her supervising faculty member. No student may be appointed as a teaching assistant for more than a total of eight semesters, excluding summer semesters. Research assistants Research assistants are appointed by individual faculty members to help them in their scholarly research work. Teaching and research assistantships are determined by a percentage of time. Assistantships in either of these categories with an assignment between 25% and 67% time will carry a tuition exemption. Assistantships for international students may not exceed a 50% assignment during the fall and spring semesters. Students who receive assistantship-based tuition exemption for the spring semester will also receive tuition exemption for the summer term immediately following, even if the assistantship does not continue through the summer. Students holding 50% teaching or research assistantships must register for at least 12 credit hours each semester. info Fellowships are awarded to graduate students in computer science in recognition of scholarly achievement and promise. Fellowships enable students to pursue graduate study and research without a service requirement, and they vary in amount and duration. For legal and taxation purposes, fellowships are regarded as gifts, not as compensation for services rendered. UIC’s centralized Graduate College is responsible for awarding fellowships. Unless stated otherwise, all fellows supported by the Graduate College are exempt from tuition and service fees. Students who hold fellowships are required to complete at least 12 semester hours each term. Funding for Graduate College fellowships is derived from both university and external sources. Please visit the Graduate College’s fellowships page for information on fellowships that are currently offered to graduate students and the terms and conditions applicable to each. info The computer science faculty may nominate a select few entering students for University Fellowships and tuition-and-fee waivers . These nominations are forwarded to the Graduate College, which makes waiver decisions. The director of graduate studies is the primary resource for information on these waivers, which are reserved for the most advanced and high-performing students. Fellows and students with a tuition-and-fee waiver must register for a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester.

This option is strongly advised if you may be interested in pursuing a PhD in the future. Researching and writing a master’s thesis is an academically intensive process that takes the place of 8 credits of traditional coursework. Students work with a faculty advisor to choose a topic of interest, engage in high-level study of that topic, and develop a paper that is suitable for presentation at a conference or submission to a journal. The thesis experience provides definition to your master’s degree experience and can bolster your application for jobs or doctoral-level study by demonstrating your capabilities. Master’s thesis students in computer science at UIC have recently studied: Reliability Issues among Android Components: Analysis, Testing and Solutions Ensuring Privacy in Legacy Web Applications through Multiple Relations Views MY-AIR Project: Study on Semantic Location and Activity Recognition Algorithms for iOS Systems Detection of Suspicious Users Posting Claims about Cancer on Twitter Exploring Deep Learning Techniques for Real-time Graphics thesis Choosing a Thesis Advisor and Committee Choosing a Thesis Advisor and Committee Your master’s thesis research is guided by a faculty advisor, and your thesis project eventually will be judged by a faculty committee of at least three members. They will be responsible for reviewing and evaluating your research. Choosing a thesis advisor is a process in which your first few semesters of coursework will be a great help. Taking courses will help you to focus a specific academic interest, which in turn will allow you to identify UIC computer science faculty experts in this area. You can find a list of the computer science faculty here . Students are responsible for identifying a prospective advisor and asking that faculty member to advise a thesis. Eligible faculty members include all assistant, associate, and full professors in computer science, as well as adjunct faculty in the department. Planning Your Thesis Planning Your Thesis Once you have a thesis advisor in place, you should meet with him or her to determine a research plan and set expectations and deadlines. With an approved research plan in place, students register for CS 598 and conduct the agreed-upon thesis research. Students who are required to maintain a specific number of registration hours may register for more than the 8 required hours of CS 598 with advisor permission, but no more than 8 hours will be used towards the requirements for the degree. Close to the conclusion of your research and writing process, you will work with your advisor to assemble a thesis committee, likely consisting of two or more additional faculty members. A majority of your committee should hold at least a 50% appointment in the computer science department, and at least one member must be a tenured faculty member. When your master’s thesis is complete, you will provide all committee members with a copy and arrange a date for your thesis defense. At least three weeks prior to your defense date, you will need to submit the committee recommendation form to the Student Affairs office. The department recommends that you schedule your defense no less than 10 business days prior to the Graduate College’s official thesis-submission deadline, so that you have time to make any changes that your committee or the Graduate College might request. An examination report will be generated by the Graduate College and sent to the Student Affairs office, which will contact you to pick up the forms. After your defense, you must visit the Student Affairs office to verify that all of graduation requirements have been met. Technical Guidance for Thesis-Option Students Technical Guidance for Thesis-Option Students Formatting and other guidelines for master’s thesis research are described in detail in a Thesis Manual published by the Graduate College. You must email a PDF copy of your thesis to the computer science Student Affairs office for a format check one week prior to the deadline set by the Graduate College.

If you envision applying for jobs in industry after graduation, you may benefit from the experience of doing a project: companies will be able to see that you can see a project through from idea to completion, and you can choose a topic that is relevant to your career plan. This substantive, capstone-style project experience takes the place of 4 credits of standard coursework. Examples of recent MS projects include: Collabsearch: A Lightweight Application for Remote Collaboration An Exploration in Improving Tools for Efficient Packet Classification Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Food Allergy from Longitudinal Microbiome Taxonomic Profiles Visualizing Religious Publics on Twitter in 2016 You will be guided in your project by a faculty advisor, and you will be evaluated based on the work you do toward the project and on a final written report. Both the project work and the written report must demonstrate a high level of professional skill, as determined by your faculty advisor and one other faculty member. You do not need to present or defend your project in order to complete the project option. project Choosing a Project Advisor Choosing a Project Advisor If you plan to complete the project option, you should identify a faculty advisor as you progress through the program and identify an area of study that interests you. When you have a project advisor in mind, reach out directly to ask the faculty member if he or she would be willing to advise your project. Who is eligible to serve as a project advisor? You may invite any computer science lecturer; assistant, associate, or full professors; or adjunct faculty member. Your faculty advisor can help you to determine the second faculty member who will participate in evaluating your project. This second faculty evaluator can come from the computer science department or, if your faculty advisor and the director of graduate studies both approve, a full-time faculty member from another department at UIC. Your advisor and the director of graduate studies will help you to make sure that important criteria are met, e.g., that one of the two faculty members must hold at least a 50% appointment in the computer science department. Planning Your Project Planning Your Project Once you have confirmed your faculty advisor, you should meet with him or her to discuss project proposals and expectations. In the semester when you intend to do the work toward your project, you must register for 4 hours of CS 597, using your faculty advisor’s course registration number. If you are required to maintain a specific number of registration hours that requires you to add more hours, you may register for more than 4 hours under CS 597 with your faculty advisor’s permission, but no more than 4 hours will be used toward the requirements for the MS degree. You will work throughout the semester on your project, with input and guidance from your advisor. The work you perform will be unique to your own proposal. Once you have completed your project work and written your final report, submit the report and the Certificate of Approval form to your advisor at least one week prior to the deadline, and provide your second faculty evaluator with a copy of the report. Your advisor and committee member must sign the Certificate of Approval form. The signed form and the final project report should then be submitted to the Student Affairs office (905 SEO). Technical Guidance for Project-Option Students Technical Guidance for Project-Option Students Your project report should be a technically focused and carefully written document.

This scholarly project allows students to engage in original research, complete a project that contributes to the state of knowledge in computer science, and crisply define their expertise and skills to future employers—including universities, corporations, government agencies, nonprofits, and other organizations. To get a sense of recently completed dissertations from the UIC computer science department, see our dissertations page . Dissertation Committee Students and their faculty advisors work together to determine an appropriate dissertation review committee. Dissertation committees are put together according to guidelines similar to those for preliminary examination committees, except that one member must be from outside the UIC computer science faculty. The following guidelines must be met: Five or more members in total At least three members are full members of the UIC Graduate College At least two are tenured (not just tenure-track) faculty A majority of the committee holds at least a 50% appointment in the computer science department One member must come from outside the department or the university (adjuncts are not considered external members) For any outside members who are not full members of the UIC Graduate College, students must submit the person’s CV along with the committee recommendation form so that the Graduate College may determine that equivalent academic standards are met. The committee recommendation form, along with an abstract, must be submitted to the computer science Student Affairs office at least three weeks prior to the scheduled dissertation defense date. The dean of the Graduate College formally appoints the dissertation at the recommendation of the department. Dissertation defenses are scheduled upon mutual agreement of the student and faculty advisor, and at the convenience of the committee members. Only students in good academic standing are allowed to proceed to the defense of the dissertation. Additional Guidelines Federal regulations require that any research that involves the use of either human subjects or animals be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the Animal Care Committee (ACC). The regulations are all-inclusive in that surveys, interviews, pre-existing data, and human tissues obtained for non-research purposes require review by the IRB before the research can be done. If the work is completed without IRB or ACC approval, it cannot be published, even as a thesis. Copies of the IRB or ACC approval must be included in the appendix of the final draft of the dissertation submitted for review by the Graduate College. It is university policy that any dissertations that are not in compliance with the Office for the Protection of Research Subjects (OPRS) will not be accepted for fulfillment of graduation requirements. For further information, visit this webpage . Formatting and other guidelines for dissertation research are described in detail in a Thesis Manual published by the Graduate College. You must email a PDF copy of your dissertation to the computer science Student Affairs office for a format check one week prior to the deadline set by the Graduate College.

Once a student passes the preliminary examination, he or she is officially considered a PhD candidate. This is the second major milestone in the PhD program, after the qualifier examination. The preliminary examination usually takes place when a student has completed most, though not necessarily all, of the coursework but has not yet made a major investment of time and effort toward dissertation research. For this examination, the student performs research under an advisor’s supervision and then defends the work before a Graduate College-approved faculty committee of at least five members. Students must pass the preliminary examination one year prior to their dissertation defense. Approval by petition is needed if students plan to hold their dissertation defense within a year of the preliminary examination. exam Preliminary Examination Committee Preliminary Examination Committee A student’s faculty advisor serves as the chair of the preliminary examination committee. The additional members of the preliminary examination committee must be selected in a way that fulfills all of the following criteria: Five or more members in total At least three members are full members of the UIC Graduate College At least two are tenured (not just tenure-track) faculty A majority of the committee holds at least a 50% appointment in the computer science department Adjuncts are not considered external members Diversity is prized in the creation of a preliminary examination committee; thus, including one or two members from outside the computer science department or UIC is encouraged. For any outside members who are not full members of the UIC Graduate College, students must submit their CVs along with the committee recommendation form so that the Graduate College may determine that equivalent academic standards are met. The committee recommendation form , along with an abstract, must be submitted to the computer science Student Affairs office at least three weeks prior to the anticipated preliminary examination date. Student Affairs will coordinate departmental approval of the form and forward it to the Graduate College for approval. The preliminary examination committee is appointed by the dean of the Graduate College at the recommendation of the computer science department. Additional Requirements Additional Requirements PhD students must submit a thesis proposal document to their committee members one week prior to the preliminary exam presentation. Students who are proposing research that involves human subjects must apply for and receive approval from UIC’s Institutional Review Board. Students who are proposing research that involves animals must apply for and receive approval from the Animal Care Committee. Pass Requirements Pass Requirements Preliminary examinations are graded as “pass” or “fail.” A candidate cannot be passed if he or she receives more than one “fail” vote from members of the committee. The Graduate College provides an examination report form to the computer science department, which must be completed and assigned by each member of the committee. If students receive a grade of “pass,” the preliminary examination committee still may require that students perform additional work or meet specified conditions before the passing recommendation becomes effective. If students receive a grade of “fail,” the preliminary examination committee may make a recommendation to the dean to allow a second examination. If the student receives a grade of “fail” on the second examination, a third examination is not permitted. Once students pass the preliminary examination, they have five years to complete the requirements for the PhD; failure to adhere to this time period will require a new preliminary examination. (Note: departments may specify shorter time periods than five years.) Students may not take the preliminary examination sooner than one full calendar year of beginning the program, and they may not conduct their dissertation defense any sooner than one full calendar year after the preliminary examination is passed, unless a special petition is made and approved by the director of graduate studies.

It’s not hard to see why. Computer science is helping self-driving cars to drive safely, allowing us to create beautiful visualizations of complex information, finding new ways to keep our personal information safe, enabling us to talk to our appliances and phones, and so much more. This is an extremely rich and diverse discipline. If you are interested in studying computer science, the UIC curriculum will ensure that you have the depth and preparation that will allow you to pursue whatever career goal you may have, from data mining to video-game design to artificial intelligence. Why is computer science housed in UIC’s College of Engineering? It’s a natural fit. Engineering is about using scientific and mathematical knowledge to enable the design and creation of complex products, and computers are one of our most powerful tools for design and creation. A degree in computer science from UIC will allow you to understand theory and practice, so that you have the power to analyze, imagine, design, and create the programs that will shape what we experience in the future. luis I chose the College of Engineering because computer science at UIC is at the top of its field. One thing UIC does better than anyone else is keeping an up-to-date curriculum—it pushes students’ limits, and then beyond that. I advise students to find computer science friends you can work with: collaboration is the key to passing. Luis Samayoa | BS in Computer Science What can we teach you about computer science? You can think about computer science as a widely varied field that spans a large spectrum. At one end of that spectrum, computer science can be defined as the study of what can be done with computation and what resources are required for that. At the other end of the spectrum, computer science can be defined as how to apply knowledge, hardware, and software to solve human and social needs. Can you think of problems in our society or in your community that could benefit from a creative solution? What bothers you in the world? With a computer science education, you might be able to come up with a creative technological solution. The UIC computer science department will train you to understand computer science at both ends of the spectrum that stretches across this fascinating field. At UIC, you will build a broad background that will serve you well into your career. You will become familiar with critical theories that underlie computer science, and you will develop applied skills in the design, implementation and validation of computer systems. In our experience, industry jobs and graduate programs value, above all, people who can solve real problems come prepared to use the tools of their trade.

Vatsal Patel The College of Engineering emphasizes practically implementing what we learn theoretically to prepare us for any challenge we face when we start our careers. It has an amazing faculty, value for the money, and a fun learning environment. Vatsal Patel | BS in Computer Science Computer Science Concentrations Concentrations allow you to define an area of focus for your major. The department offers three concentrations, each of which requires that you complete a specific collection of courses. These concentrations may affect the choices you make in the categories above. (Your advisors and professors will help you navigate this during your time at UIC.) The concentrations are: Computer systems Software engineering Human-centered computing Computer Systems The computer systems concentration focuses on understanding and designing computer hardware. Students in this concentration continue to learn the fundamentals of computer science—programming, data structures, discrete math, algorithms, formal languages, architecture and operating systems—but they also delve into low-level circuit analysis and high-level system design and have the option to take additional hardware-oriented courses. The result is a unique blend of computer science and computer engineering. Software Engineering The software engineering concentration emphasizes the knowledge and skills needed to begin a professional practice in software engineering. In addition to the fundamental areas of computer science, including programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems, students study key topics such as software cost estimation, large-scale software development, and risk management. Human-Centered Computing The human-centered computing concentration prepares students to pursue areas such as user-interface design and development and computer graphics and animation. Applications of these skills might include video games, movie special effects, and visualization in science, engineering, and medicine. In addition to the fundamental areas of computer science—programming, data structures, discrete mathematics, algorithms, formal languages, computer architecture, and operating systems—the concentration educates students in user-interface design, computer graphics, visual media, and natural language processing.

The mini-profiles below offer a few examples of the thousands of rewarding careers pursued by alumni of UIC’s undergraduate program in computer science. Kevin Bell, BS ’19 Software Engineer Discover What are some of your day-to-day tasks? Writing code, prepping for product installs, and learning about and implementing security tools. I’m a part of the Ninjitsu team at Discover, and I work on the web platform using Java. What’s great about your job? The culture at Discover was the main factor that made me want to work here in the first place. Everyone is kind, professional, and understanding. Also, I’m learning a lot in a short amount of time, so it’s great for growth. What was the most valuable student organization you joined, and why? Black Tech Scholars because it brought awareness to the fact that there are people like me who want to help people like me. Now, I have a strong feeling of needing to pay back that effort. Would you recommend the College of Engineering to new applicants? If so, why? Yes. If you want a challenge to grow and to succeed in life, then UIC is the perfect place for you. There’s so much to learn, so many people to meet, and so many opportunities to come from the experience that it’s a no-brainer to recommend the College of Engineering. Emily Austin, BS ’16 Program Manager AstrumU What are some of your day-to-day tasks? I talk with people to solve their problems and keep work moving forward. I sometimes get clarification from one person or need to gather a group to decide how we’ll tackle a problem. I balance priorities between developers, data scientists, product managers, and sales managers in planning workloads. I collaborate with others to define company road maps and goals in a language that crosses technical and non-technical teams. I maintain internal tools that help the engineering team move smoothly. What was your favorite course? CS 450 Introduction to Networking . It has a lot of fun concepts and leaves you wondering how it all works. The course was tough, but I took it with friends, and we studied and struggled together. After the course, I learned that I don’t want to specialize in networking or work on it day-to-day, but I enjoy discussing concepts and seeing how networking relates to everything in technology. What was the most valuable student organization you joined, and why? The Association for Computing Machinery . This is where I met friends when I first joined UIC. I found people with similar interests, peers in my classes to study with, and events where I could learn more about the technical field. In my third and fourth years, I was vice president and president, respectively. I learned more about leadership, interfaced with external companies and university staff, and got to welcome students to the organization who reminded me of myself when I joined UIC. Fun fact about you that few people are aware of: I play Magic the Gathering limited format. I’ve been to Grand Prix in Seattle and Portland and played against the director of Magic R&D in a random matchup.

That endeavor may involve giving us all greater peace of mind online by improving the security of our personal data and communications. It might mean developing forms of artificial intelligence that collaborate with, rather than simply compete with, human beings. It includes finding new ways to use technology in classrooms to teach and learn, and novel expressions of data as compelling, useful visuals. In our department, methods of improving quality of life extend to animals, too, as our faculty work on computational methods to understand wild animal populations and ensure their future viability and health. One of the concepts that attracts today’s undergraduates to computer science is the fact that computing is stitched into nearly everything we touch, see, and do on a daily basis. If you change computing, you change the world. That idea is what drives UIC computer science researchers, too. Our faculty design original investigations, pursue grants, and publish work widely with the goal of increasing our overall understanding and command of computing in our society today. Other researchers in computer science, whether just starting their careers or highly accomplished in the field, are encouraged to join our community of scholars as colleagues or as external collaborators.

Mohammad Taha Khan PhD in Computer Science | Pakistan Academic focus: Internet security and privacy. I create tools that I believe will make the Internet more secure and usable. Most rewarding aspect of the program: The sense of achievement and reward after your work gets accepted to conferences and journals. Name one thing you think UIC does best: Work-life balance Favorite place in Chicago: Montrose Harbor. It’s a few blocks from my home, and it’s usually empty. A great place to clear one’s mind and hear the waves while watching the distant planes and stars over Lake Michigan. There’s also a pretty decent view of the skyline. Place you’re most likely to be found on campus: In my lab or at Chick-fil-a Aditi Mallavarapu PhD in Computer Science | India Academic focus: Educational data mining, learning sciences, human-computer interface. What’s the most rewarding part of doing research at UIC? The encouragement and the multi-fold opportunities that open up for me. The exposure to multi-disciplinary research is the key. I can see how my research is making a difference in the world. What difference do you see yourself making? My current work is with a digital museum, where I am trying to evaluate the learning gains that are achieved by the visitors as they interact with the exhibit. We have been able to design a tool that can give visitors live feedback on how they are performing. The museum-exhibit evaluations have become easier for the staff, and the visitors are more aware of the takeaways from the exhibit. Find me on: The Magnificent Mile and the Chicago Riverwalk . Yanzi Jin PhD in Computer Science | China Academic focus: Computer vision, specifically the analysis of surveillance videos. How will your research help the world? Practically, my system will make traffic analysis cheaper and more efficient. More generally, my research addresses the challenges when applying computer vision techniques to real-world problems. Hopefully it will bridge the academic and the practical, and raise awareness for the field. Why UIC? I knew I would like to work on something that could be applied to real life, and that’s what my advisor, Jakob Eriksson , does. Home neighborhood in Chicago: Bridgeport Mohitkumar Paritosh Ghia MS in Computer Science | India Academic focus: Artificial intelligence and software development Why UIC? It was one of the best colleges in terms of research opportunities and course offerings.

Daley Library or Student Center East , working collaboratively or meeting friends over coffee and food. David Randolph PhD in Computer Science | Joliet, IL Academic focus: Music informatics, machine learning, educational technology The UIC advantage: The department advertised a part-time PhD option. It was the only such program I found when I was scouting for somewhere to continue my studies. I was working full-time and needed a place that would be flexible. Dissertation title: Actionable Computational Models of Piano Fingering A snapshot of PhD life: I have been lucky enough to collaborate with a number of musicians, engineers, psychologists, and computer scientists, both inside and outside UIC, in a true multi-disciplinary extravaganza. But I think my absolute favorite part was building a Frankenstein digital piano with a micro-controller, foil tape, some mysterious electronic components, and no prior soldering experience. Research contribution: I like to think that a system that can dispense high-quality fingering advice could someday lead to a tutorial or decision-support system that will help pianists prepare pieces for performance. Better fingering = better music. Also, as injury is a serious issue among pianists, such a system might help pianists to strike a healthier balance between ergonomics and musical expressiveness. Hamed Rezaei MS in Computer Science | Iran Academic focus: Improving congestion-control methods in datacenter networks What contribution will your research make? Improving user satisfaction. We can improve the speed of connection to datacenter networks, which is a part of everybody’s life today.

Born in Buffalo, New York, he completed his undergraduate work in mathematics at Yale University and received his master’s degree in 1986 and his PhD in 1989, both in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Beginning in January 2001, he served for two years as the program director of the Theory of Computing Program at the National Science Foundation, managing the multi-million-dollar program through two funding cycles. Today, he is a member of the Department of Homeland Security’s Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee. Dr. Sloan’s scholarly work in computer science is presently divided between two areas. One area is problems near the boundary of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence, including learning, knowledge representation, and commonsense reasoning. The other is computer security and privacy public policy, an area in which he collaborates closely with Professor Richard Warner of Chicago-Kent Law School. Together they wrote the book Unauthorized Access: The Crisis in Online Privacy and Security, which was published by CRC Press in 2013. In the past, Dr. Sloan also has published in cryptography and in technical areas of computer security, primarily access control. As department head, Dr. Sloan oversees curriculum development in computer science, ensuring that UIC students receive the education they need to compete and succeed in industry and academia. He has helped the department to keep pace with unchecked growth in student interest, and he has played a significant role in recruiting a large group of new faculty—13 new members in fall 2018 alone. Dr. Sloan engages with a wide range of corporate and academic partners and works actively to secure external funding for computer science initiatives at UIC.

The board voted to approve all construction-related activity for UI Health’s new 200,000-square-foot Outpatient Surgery Center and Specialty Clinics building, which will be located at the southeast corner of Wood and Taylor streets. This includes approval for the university to enter into the agreements necessary to finalize the public-private partnership that will provide the majority of financing for the new $194 million building. The board also approved a $117.8 budget for the Computer Design Research and Learning Center, a 125,000-square-foot mixed-use space for UIC’s College of Engineering. The building will be designed to meet LEED Gold certification standards for environmental sustainability and will be located at 900 W. Taylor St., adjacent to Memorial Grove. “UIC’s students, staff and faculty are among Chicago’s most driven and innovative leaders and they need and deserve world-class facilities,” said UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. “These new buildings are an investment in our and Chicago’s future. They will enhance significantly our teaching, research and clinical operations and will allow UIC to advance, grow and flourish.” The Outpatient Surgery Center and Specialty Clinics building will include six floors of patient care space, including eight operating and eight procedure rooms, 48 pre- and post-surgery bays, clinic space for GI, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, transplant and urology clinics, and a pharmacy. “UI Health brings together seven health sciences colleges and a significant portfolio of bench to community research with a world-class, public clinical care delivery system,” said Dr. Robert Barish, vice chancellor for health affairs at UIC. “This building will serve as a new hub for our top-ranked ophthalmology and transplant programs, and we are looking forward to bringing this new, comfortable space to our patients.” Under the public-private partnership between UIC and Provident Resources Group, a 501(c)(3) corporation, Provident will finance nearly three-quarters of the cost of the building through tax-exempt bonds and lease the facility to UI Health during the 30-year term of the bonds. Additional funding will come from the health system and private philanthropy. In November 2019, Bruno and Sallie Pasquinelli pledged $10 million for the project. “UI Health continues to see 5% annual growth in outpatient surgeries across many surgical services lines and the new building will also provide the space needed for our growing specialty clinics,” said Michael Zenn, CEO of University of Illinois Hospital & Clinics. “Using a public-private partnership model will allow us to move forward on an accelerated timeline while working collaboratively with developers, architects, contractors and others to ensure the building will best serve the needs of our community.” The project will be presented to the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board on April 7. Pending approval, groundbreaking is planned for August 2020. Completion of the project is expected in 2022. The Computer Design Research and Learning Center will include a 1,200-square-foot robotics lab and 16,000 square feet of classroom space. It also will be the new home for UIC’s Electronic Visualization Laboratory, an internationally renowned interdisciplinary research lab. “This new building represents the extraordinary momentum of the UIC College of Engineering, which has grown to serve more than 5,300 students each year,” said Peter Nelson, dean of the college. “The building will also serve as an important space for our computer science department, which has seen skyrocketing enrollments, has six specialties ranked in the top 25 nationally and is leading the nation in recruiting world-class faculty members,” Nelson said. Over the last 15 years, the UIC computer science department has grown from 187 undergraduate students to more than 1,400 students, and since 2018, the department has hired 13 new faculty members. The computer science department has approximately $45 million in active research grants, with national CSRankings in: web and information retrieval (7), economics and computation (12), artificial intelligence (17), logic and verification (17), machine learning and data mining (21), and natural language processing (21). The mixed-use space will include research labs and collaborative areas for students and research groups. “Computer science is also an increasingly popular minor among UIC students from a number of programs, like liberal arts and business, so this building will have an impact on many students across campus,” Nelson said. The new building will be the second new construction project for UIC’s College of Engineering in recent years. The Engineering Innovation Building, which is home to the Chicago area’s only high-bay structural research laboratory, opened in July 2019. Groundbreaking is estimated for November 2020 and completion is expected in 2022. This story first appeared on UIC Today .

The high school computer science class is a recent graduation requirement for Chicago Public School (CPS) high school students, and Tse and Chen taught cybersecurity and robotics in three sections of teacher Cindy Lilagan’s honors classes. Tse heard about the program after reading about Dale Reed’s involvement in bringing computer science instruction to CPS schools . Reed, a clinical professor and director of undergraduate recruitment at UIC, was interested in seeing how high school students would relate to and understand more advanced computer science curriculum. Chen has served as a teaching assistant (TA) for Reed for four semesters. Tse and Chen were accepted by Lilagan and Jones Prep to teach the course. Chen said the use of robotics could teach the students cybersecurity concepts: when a student writes code, they can spoof each other’s robots, intercept and break one another’s encryption signals, and use Caesar’s cipher, one of the simplest and most widely known encryption methods, where each plain text letter is replaced by another set number or position down the alphabet. “The students knew some of this already, but we also went over how things are hacked in their social life—how advertising companies get their information online, for example,” Chen said. Upcoming lessons would involve battles between the student’s robots. With CPS classes moved online due to Covid19, the future of Tse and Chen’s involvement in the program for this semester is uncertain. They finished designing the entire curriculum, but some of the material—including the robot battles—cannot easily translate online. “Miss Lilagan said it’s possible to host a Google meetup or hangout, but some of CPS online learning is up in the air. Some students do not have access,” Tse said. For Tse, helping expose high schoolers to computer science is a passion. Tse was on the path to becoming a doctor, and holds a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry from Case Western University. After shadowing a few doctors, she had a change of heart, just before graduation. Tse discovered computer science through her younger sister, and decided to return to school for a second bachelor’s degree, after working with Girls Who Code , a nonprofit that teaches women coding and computer skills (UIC also offers a Girls Who Code at UIC Club ). Now, Tse is working on a dual bachelor’s/master’s degree in computer science at UIC. “I’m at a crossroads right now. I’m very interested in a PhD in learning sciences intermixed with CS,” Tse said. “I’m also interning as a data engineer, which is very interesting as well.” Tse is working with Reed and PhD candidates at UIC, getting a sense for what life as a PhD student would be like. Her internship is with Synchrony Financial, where she is developing a tool for their enterprise data lake. (Both data lakes and data warehouses are widely used for storing big data, but a data lake is a large pool of raw data, whereas information held in a data warehouse is structured, and has already been processed for a specific purpose.) Tse is helping the transition to data lakes for the company. She worked previously as a summer immersion program instructor with Girls Who Code. “It is so important that students, especially high schoolers, get exposed to computer science,” Tse said. Chen, a junior, is hoping to work with the Jones students, even in a volunteer capacity, perhaps in the fall. He returned over UIC’s spring break to his family’s home in Taiwan, and will complete the school year from overseas. Although he’s been a TA for two years at UIC, Chen has found the experience at Jones to be enlightening. “You can teach hard material in an easier and more understandable way. Even the most difficult material can be taught more simply,” Chen said. Chen is looking forward to his senior year at UIC, and hopes to work as a software engineer after graduation.

Efforts will include developing educational opportunities for women and other underrepresented groups at UIC and nearby community colleges to learn about computer science. Efforts will also include creating pathways for computer science students to secure paid internship opportunities during freshman or sophomore year. “We want to see a 12.5% increase in the representation of women graduating from our undergraduate computer science program and we want 100% of those women to have meaningful internships on their resumes when they graduate,” said Robert Sloan, UIC professor and head of computer science. Sloan says the field of computer science has a diversity problem. “Computer science is the only one of the STEM fields where the fraction of women graduates has declined over the past few decades,” he said. “Today, women represent less than 20% of computer science graduates nationally, but 35 years ago more than one-third of graduates were women.” Sloan said women represent 20% of graduates from UIC’s growing undergraduate computer science program, which will spearhead the initiative at UIC. The program is ranked ninth by CSRankings for artificial intelligence and machine learning research among all the nation’s public universities and in the top 25 among all U.S. universities in four other major computer science disciplines: web and information retrieval (7 th ), economics and computation (12 th ), logic and verification (17 th ), and natural language processing (22 nd ). Over the last 15 years, the UIC computer science department, which is part of the university’s College of Engineering, has grown from 187 undergraduate students to more than 1,400 students. “This partnership is an opportunity for the UIC College of Engineering to help change the face of computer science and tech in Chicago and nationally,” Sloan said. “Our country and cities need computer science professionals, developers, researchers and educators and, frankly, we all lose if those individuals represent only a narrow segment of the population.” Sloan said that, contrary to existing stereotypes, teamwork and collaboration are fundamental in computer science. “Diversity in these teams leads to better results,” he said, using the example of improving voice recognition technology to recognize all kinds of voices, not just male voices. To develop the new educational and internship programs for engaging women and underrepresented groups, the college’s computer science department will receive funding from Break Through Tech. Break Through Tech, which announced its expansion into Chicago today, pioneered a similar program, called WiTNY — for Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York — in New York City with City University of New York. “We are proud that UIC was selected as the first university for the national expansion of Break Through Tech,” said Peter Nelson, UIC dean of the College of Engineering. “We look forward to working with Cornell Tech and building a successful program here in Chicago. The Cornell Tech grant to support our efforts is one of the largest grants the UIC College of Engineering has ever received.” “Break Through Tech has a track record of success engaging and graduating women in tech fields and we are eager to partner with them to create programs for Chicago students,” Sloan said. Educational opportunities will include new introductory computer science courses and workshops that teach students how to code and emphasize real-world applications of technology. Unlike many internship programs, the new opportunities for UIC students will be held during the university’s winter break. “Winternships” will provide students with chances to build their resumes with real-world experiences that increase their chances of landing coveted summer tech internships, which are key experiences that tech recruiters look for when evaluating graduates for full-time employment. “Break Through Tech is thrilled to partner with the computer science department at UIC and build upon their successes of the last several years,” said Judith Spitz, executive director of Break Through Tech. “Our experience in New York has shown us that a deep partnership with a public university that has both scale and diversity, the delivery of a continuity of programming that supports women and other underrepresented groups throughout their college journey and innovative partnerships with the industry players within the city is a formula that delivers transformation results for both the students and the tech ecosystem.” New introductory courses and workshops will be held beginning in May 2020 and the first cohort of students in the winternship program are expected to start as early as December 2020.

Translating research into action is part of UIC’s legacy. HIV medication adherence is crucial for reducing viral load and lessening the risk that the virus will be passed to another person. But consistent adherence can be difficult, which is why researchers at UIC have developed an avatar-based app, with built in medication reminders and educational modules, that functions in the privacy of a user’s own phone. Biopsies can be frightening and painful, but one day they may be performed with a simple blood tests thanks to a new microfluidics device that can separate cancer cells from blood. The device has the potential to enable faster cancer diagnoses and reduce stress for patients. Why do Hispanic people tend to live longer even though they carry a higher burden of certain diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes compared to other populations? Getting to the bottom of the so-called “Hispanic paradox” is what researchers in the Institute for Minority Health Research hope to achieve with funding from the NIH for the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos- the largest-ever study of this population. UIC os one of four field centers. The others are in San Diego, the Bronx and Miami.

Data mining at UIC has some of the most cited researchers in the field working to extract meaning from huge data sets in ways that will revolutionize everything from marketing to medicine. Computational biology brings the power of computers to the world of animal conservation. Computer science faculty engaged in cybersecurity programs are exploring everything from understanding how data is collected and used to finding better ways to protect online purchases on smartphones. A $1.4 million grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to design, develop and evaluate a system that will identify security vulnerabilities in web software will engage undergraduate and graduate students interested in learning about state-of-the-art digital security tools. UIC’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory developed and maintains the Illinois Department of Transportation’s real-time traffic map, the Gateway system. UIC’s computer science faculty include leaders in natural language processing , networked systems , database investigations and computer science theory. Computer science Electronic Visualization Laboratory Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Public health & health policy UIC researchers take an active part in local, national and international public health and policy conversations, and their contributions have led to changes that are saving lives. From Project HEAL, which has increased the number of Chicagoans who know their HIV status, to research investigating the efficacy of an app to improve HIV medication adherence among gay black men, UIC researchers are making a real impact on reducing the unintended spread of HIV. By partnering with the Chicago Park District to conduct same-day water testing that park officials use to guide swim advisories that warn swimmers of dangerous bacteria levels, UIC directly protects the health of thousands of beachgoers and swimmers every summer. The program has expanded to include 20 Chicago beaches. Researchers in UIC’s CDC-funded Illinois Prevention Research Center, housed in the UIC School of Public, conduct research that will help guide public health policies and environmental changes aimed at improving nutrition, physical activity, and tobacco avoidance to reduce chronic disease risk — and to diminish disparities among population groups in these health behaviors and outcomes. Their work will look at how numerous social determinants of health, including access to healthy food, transportation and the availability of places for recreation and exercise impact health. The Center for Health Equity Research Chicago is a National Institutes of Health-funded Center of Excellence, based out of the University of Illinois Cancer Center and the UIC School of Public Health and in collaboration with the University of Chicago Medicine, dedicated to researching how various social structures and determinants contribute to the health of marginalized groups. Co-led by UIC reserachers, the Chicago Center for Health and Environment promotes multidisciplinary environmental health research among clinician, laboratory and population scientists in Chicago to evaluate and ultimately reduce environmental health-related disparities among residents of the region and beyond. Center for Health Equity Research Institute for Health Research and Policy School of Public Health Chicago Center for Health and Environment Project HEAL Pharmacy A cure for Alzheimer’s disease, easing the pain linked to sickle cell disease, or uncovering new treatments for ovarian and breast cancer may one day occur through research at the College of Pharmacy . UIC researchers go to great lengths to find new discoveries that impact the world’s health. Scientists comb the depths of the oceans and Great Lakes to collect bacteria that can potentially be used to develop new antibiotic drugs to cure infectious diseases. They search the Asian rainforests to find plants that may contain biologically active molecules that may one day be developed to cure cancer, AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Look on the shelf of any health store and you will find a natural product that is being studied at UIC’s Botanical Center. Scientists are testing the safety and value of botanicals — especially those that may help women — focusing on plants that are commonly available as dietary supplements. Hops, licorice, mangosteen, black cohosh and red clover are just some of the natural products studied at UIC. The College of Pharmacy is currently the No. 6 ranked pharmacy school in the United States by U.S. News & World Report and has consistently ranked in the top 7 in external research funding, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. College of Pharmacy Sustainability As a public research university in the heart of Chicago, UIC is especially aware of its impact on the city and the role it plays in bringing sustainable practices and policies to the campus, the city, the state and the world through example and research. The Chancellor’s Committee on Sustainability and Energy has recently developed a set of Climate Commitments that will help the university achieve carbon neutrality, become a zero waste and net zero water campus and increase biodiversity on campus grounds. There are many ways to make sustainability the focus of your studies at UIC. Earth and Environmental Sciences , Civil and Materials Engineering, Urban Planning and Policy and several other departments offer different paths to careers in sustainability. Courses in nearly every department reflect the broad scope of this issue. At UIC, you are urged to think about how sustainability applies to every aspect of life, whether you study accounting, art, education, geography, physics or public health. Earth and Environmental Sciences Civil and Materials Engineering Urban Planning and Policy Dentistry There’s more to dentistry than cleaning teeth, filling cavities and performing root canals. The College of Dentistry has 16 clinics that treat patients of all ages and trains the most dentists in the state of Illinois. Oral health researchers conduct groundbreaking studies, from working toward a future of eliminating tooth decay, to studying whether green tea can inhibit the growth of cancer cells in smokers, to performing studies on how proteins can regrow dentin to one day bring a new way to fill cavities. To prepare a capable and dedicated workforce that addresses the oral health needs of vulnerable and underserved populations, fourth-year dental students are required to participate in service-learning experiences at community-based rotations in partnering clinics. The health centers are located throughout the Chicago area, Illinois, Colorado and internationally, including Guatemala, China and Tanzania. The college has several specialty facilities, including the Center for Wound Healing and Tissue Regeneration, where a community of scientists and clinicians investigate how the body reacts to injury, as well as mechanisms of repairing and regenerating tissues.

Lying between the east and west sides of campus and stretching from our north to south, it’s an area that is diverse both ethnically and socioeconomically. Once known as “Hull House neighborhood,” Jane Addams’ original home and the resident’s dining hall still stand as a museum. Other nearby icons include the Christopher Columbus statue and Our Lady of Pompeii church. While University Village bustles with new housing and businesses, Little Italy’s heritage is displayed prominently in the restaurants of Taylor Street. Cultural Attractions National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame Hull-House Museum Arrigo Park Pilsen Located to the south of UIC, Pilsen got its name in the late 19th century from the mostly Czech immigrant population. During the 1960s, there was a large growth in the Latino population in the area and it is now the largest Mexican-American neighborhood in Chicago. The neighborhood celebrates its culture and art with colorful public murals and mosaics, as well as art galleries and museums. The real flavor of the area comes through in the Mexican bakeries, restaurants and groceries that line the active 18th Street corridor. Cultural Attractions National Museum of Mexican Art Murals Dvorak Park Greektown / West Loop Once the home of factories, wholesale markets and warehouses, the West Loop is one of Chicago’s fastest growing neighborhoods. Among the rising loft and condo buildings are tech firms, retailers and restaurants. Located at the north end of the UIC campus, also boasts art galleries, dance companies, designers, boutiques and music venues. At the edge of the neighborhood is Greektown, which holds strong to its Greek heritage and celebrates Greek food and traditions even as the rest of the area transforms. Cultural Attractions National Hellenic Museum Hubbard Street Dance Mary Bartelme Park Navy Pier to Museum Campus / the Loop From the lakefront to the Loop, Navy Pier to Soldier Field shines Chicago’s favorite playground for locals and global visitors alike. Navy Pier is now home to amusement rides and sightseeing, but once hosted the World’s Columbian Exposition. It was later used for Navy training then housed UIC’s first campus. Grant , Millennium and Maggie Daley parks offer fun, culture, sights and sounds for all. Farther south is the Museum Campus with three natural science museums: Adler Planetarium , Shedd Aquarium and the Field Museum .

Chicago fundamentals Brush up on these facts about the unique flavor, history and sites of Chicago. With this information you may win a few trivia contests and sound like a lifelong Chicagoan. What makes it Chicago-style? Chicago is a great food city, and some of our distinct flavor comes from Chicago-style pizza and hot dogs. Our deep-dish pizza is unique because of its height and the order of its ingredients: the pizza is covered in cheese then smothered in tomato sauce. Chicago hot dogs sit on a poppy-seed bun covered with mustard, onions, relish, tomatoes, pickle spear, pickled peppers and celery salt — and most importantly: no ketchup! Dining in Chicago Architecture Chicago is home to the very first skyscraper. The Home Insurance Building was built in 1885 by William Le Baron Jenney. The Willis (Sears) Tower is present-day Chicago’s largest skyscraper. Built in 1970, the shape was named as the “bundle tube structure” and is famous for its two antennas. See all of Chicago’s great architecture via the many walking and bus tours as well as boat tours on the Chicago River during the warmer months. To see the city from above, check out the observation decks at Willis Tower or the Hancock Building . Chicago Architecture Foundation The Chicago Fire Legend says the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 was started by a cow kicking over a lantern. It’s real cause unknown, the fire destroyed three-and-a-half square miles of the city. The Chicago Water Tower was one of the few buildings to survive and still stands today along the Magnificent Mile in downtown Chicago. The re-built Chicago included fireproof buildings and the first skyscraper made of steel, introducing the city to the industrial revolution. More Chicago history The Loop Most Chicagoans know the Loop to be the rectangular ring of elevated train tracks in the central business district, but some say that the name first referred to the downtown cable car turning loops. The officially designated community area named the Loop, however, expands beyond the “L” train hub. It stretches from Lake Michigan to the Chicago River and south to Roosevelt Road. Inside the Loop you’ll find City Hall, Millennium Park, Chicago Board of Trade, shopping on State Street, great restaurants and a variety of cultural and civic attractions. Explore the Loop The Lakefront/Burnham Plan In 1909, Daniel Burnham and Edward H. Bennett created the Plan of Chicago after studying cities across the world. The commonly-called Burnham Plan was created to improve the city so that it could better serve its growing population. One of the biggest goals of the plan was to improve and increase access to Chicago’s lakefront. Other elements included developing civic and cultural centers, larger streets, railroads and a highway system. It also introduced the grid system to the city. Digital essay on the Plan of Chicago Second City Although Chicago is now the third largest city in the U.S., it was second only to New York for nearly 100 years in the aftermath of the 1871 fire. Some say the nickname Second City first came from New Yorker magazine writer Abbott J. Liebling’s less-than-flattering book Chicago: The Second City . However, others say it arose like the city from the ashes of the great fire when the “second city” of Chicago was built. Whatever the origins, today you’re more likely to hear it called Chi-Town, the Windy City or Sweet Home Chicago.

In the 20th century, new campuses were built in Chicago and later joined together to form a comprehensive learning community. In the last three decades, UIC has transformed itself into one of the top 65 research universities in the United States. UIC: From Pier to Present Take a look back to learn about the history of UIC and how the University came to be an acclaimed research institution with 16 colleges and more than 31,000 students vital to the educational, technological and cultural fabric of the region. Watch UIC: From Pier to Present Alumni We celebrate graduates from every era History in detail Serving Chicago for more than a century Architecture Virtual tour explores historic Netsch campus buildings 1859 to 1945: Early medical roots As part of the University of Illinois, UIC grew to meet the needs of the people of Illinois, but its deepest roots are in health care. The Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, predated the Civil War is the oldest unit in the university. Other early colleges were the College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Columbian College of Dentistry. These Chicago-based health colleges became fully incorporated in 1913 as the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy. The College of Pharmacy was the first pharmacy school west of the Alleghenies and emphasized laboratory instruction and research. Dentistry became the first American dental school fully equipped with electric drills. The College of Medicine developed the country’s first occupational therapy program and grew rapidly to become the largest medical school in the U.S. In the decades following incorporation , several other health science colleges were created. Together with the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy , they formed the Chicago Professional Colleges of the University of Illinois. In 1961, the professional colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center. 1945 to 65: Navy Pier years Following World War II, the University of Illinois increased its presence in Chicago by creating a temporary, two-year branch campus on Navy Pier. The Chicago Undergraduate Division primarily accommodated student veterans on the G.I. Bill. The program allowed all students to complete their first two years of study in Chicago before going downstate to finish their undergraduate degrees at Urbana-Champaign. The lakeside location earned the Navy Pier campus the name “Harvard on the rocks.” The university shared the 3,000-foot pier with other tenants that included the Chicago Police Department Traffic Division and several military detachments. At that time Navy Pier was not the bright, attractive venue it is today as Chicago’s leading tourist attraction. The pier was a dreary, functioning port facility. But because the pier had only a single corridor along its half-mile length, students were able to see their peers each day. Richard J. Daley Richard J. Daley envisioned and established a public university for the city of Chicago. UIC’s Richard J. Daley Library holds the late mayor’s personal and family archive and political papers of two other Chicago mayors. More about Daley's role in establishing UIC 1965 to 81: University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UICC) After the war, and after the wave of returning veterans seeking education benefits under the G.I. Bill had passed through, demand for a public university in Chicago remained high. The university made plans to create a permanent, degree-granting campus in the Chicago area. The site was a 100-acre parcel at the junction of Greektown and Little Italy. To accommodate a planned student body of 32,000 in such a small area, famed Chicago architect Walter Netsch arrayed the campus buildings in concentric rings, like a droplet of water. The University of Illinois at Chicago Circle – named for the nearby ultra-modern freeway interchange – opened in February 1965. “Circle,” as it was called, was a degree-granting institution, with ambitions to become a great university. A member of the faculty proudly noted it was the first university to be named for a transportation feature since Oxford and Cambridge. Within five years of the campus’s opening – a period during which it was the fastest growing campus in the country – enrollment grew from 5,000 to 18,000 and almost every department offered graduate degrees. Befitting the location of the campus at a crossroads of immigration, many of Circle’s students were first in their families to attend college – as are many of UIC’s students today. Stanley Ikenberry Despite opposition fears that a merger would harm Circle’s urban mission or the reputations of the medical faculty, former university president Stanley Ikenberry signaled his support for unifying the Medical Center and Circle campuses by walking from one to the other. The new UIC was created in 1982 and within five years had attained Carnegie “Research I” classification. More about the creation of UIC 1982 and on: University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) UIC was born in 1982, when the Circle and Medical Center campuses consolidated to form a comprehensive university campus with six health science colleges and an academic medical center. Consolidation helped UIC reach elite Carnegie “Research I” status. In 1993, then-UIC Chancellor (and later UI President) James Stukel launched the Great Cities Initiative to join UIC teaching and research with community, corporate and government partners in tackling urban challenges. Renamed the Great Cities Commitment at it’s ten-year mark, the signature program integrates research with genuine community engagement. In the 2000s, UIC’s South Campus development brought student housing, retail stores, restaurants and private residences to the historic Maxwell Street neighborhood. The influx of faculty and staff families and the expansion of student housing helped UIC change from a daytime commuter campus into a vibrant, 24-hour academic community. Today, one-third of UIC freshmen and about one-fifth of undergraduates live on campus. In July 2019, UIC opened its newest campus living facility. The 10-story Academic and Residential Complex , which is part of a public-private partnership, holds 550 beds in a mix of traditional dorm rooms and suite-style units. Three large lecture halls, four classrooms, several small group study rooms, a tutoring center, computer stations and collaboration spaces are highlights of the facility’s academic areas. The Engineering Innovation Building , which also opened in July 2019, is the first new academic building on the east side of campus since 1991. The 50,000-square-foot facility houses instructional space, research labs and faculty and staff offices. The building also includes the University’s first high-bay structural research lab, where researchers can carry out a wide range of tests on large-scale structural components. Additional new campus construction projects are underway to support scholarship and research and improve the student experience. In August 2019, UIC acquired the John Marshall Law School and formed Chicago’s only public law school. Formerly an independent private school, John Marshall was founded in 1899 and for over a century upheld a tradition of diversity, innovation and opportunity and provided an education that combines an understanding of the theory, the philosophy and the practice of law. The creation of UIC John Marshall Law School provides current and prospective law students with more affordable education, as well as enhanced student services, such as access to health care, recreational facilities, residence halls and college athletics. There will be opportunities to take interdisciplinary courses, and new joint-degree and dual-degree programs are in development. These courses and programs align with UIC’s strengths in disciplines such as the health sciences, engineering and technology, urban planning and public administration, the social sciences and business. UIC mascots Navy Pier’s athletic teams were known as the “Chi-Illini.” The move to Circle campus brought a new identity as the “Chikas” in homage to the Chikasaw nation. When UIC was created, students selected the “Flames” as team name, recalling the 1871 Chicago fire. Mascot Sparky D. Dragon has fired up fans for more than 20 years.

Photo: Amod Mahadik University of Illinois at Chicago student Wasan Kumar believes
that everyone should have an equal opportunity to live a healthy life, but his
research and community outreach have made it clear that where a person resides
may prevent that possibility. As part of West Side United and Rush University Medical Center, he has been implementing a program to identify patients with social determinant of health needs and connecting them with the relevant resources. At UI Health, he has been studying contextualized care errors, which occur when physicians overlook crucial environmental or social factors when making medical decisions. “These experiences taught me how various social and environmental
factors can impact an individual’s health, but also how the proper allocation
of resources and power can mitigate these effects,” said Kumar, a junior in
neuroscience in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Based on his demonstrated commitment to finding solutions for
challenges facing communities, Kumar has earned an honor from Campus Compact, a
national nonprofit coalition of more than 1,000 colleges and universities,
which named him among 290 students nationwide to its 2020-2021 Newman Civic
Fellowship cohort. UIC Chancellor Michael
Amiridis nominated Kumar for the fellowship, which provides a
variety of learning and networking opportunities, including a national
conference of Newman Civic Fellows. It also offers fellows with pathways to apply for
exclusive scholarship and post-graduate opportunities. The native of Skokie, Illinois, serves as a health educator and leadership council member for UIC’s chapter of the Peer Health Exchange, a nonprofit organization that teaches health education to first-year high school students in Chicago Public Schools. He also has been involved with health policy work as an intern in the office of state Rep. Theresa Mah. “This award will significantly advance my potential as a public service changemaker and shows me that I’m making an impact,” said Kumar, a member of the UIC Honors College. “I owe a huge thanks to my mentors in the Global Asian studies and public policy programs here at UIC, as well as Representative Mah, Dr. David Ansell and Dr. Andre Kajdacsy-Balla for their constant support.” Kumar, who last year earned a prestigious Goldwater scholarship based on his academic achievements in the field of science, has studied the effects of heavy metals on cardiovascular disease as part of a research team in the UIC College of Medicine’s department of pathology. He has been a frequent presenter at conferences and his undergraduate
research has been backed by grants from the Liberal Arts and Sciences
Undergraduate Research Initiative and the Honors College. Kumar’s other
university honors include the Chancellor’s Service and Leadership Award and the
Maurice Prize, an undergraduate innovation competition. Kumar also is minoring in Global Asian studies at UIC, where he participates in civic and health matters involving the South Asian community and serves as president of the Indian Students Association. In a quest for a career as a physician-scientist
devoted to improving public health, his post-undergraduate plans are to earn a
medical degree with a focus in molecular pathology and a Ph.D. in epidemiology. “I want to develop innovative
nationwide policies that reduce the impact of the structural inequities that
determine health,” said Kumar, a 2017 graduate of the Illinois Math and Science
Academy. “The stories of this year’s Newman
Civic Fellows make clear that they are committed to finding solutions to
pressing problems in their communities and beyond. That is what Campus Compact
is about, and it’s what our country and our world desperately need,” said
Andrew Seligsohn, president of Campus Compact. The Newman Civic Fellowship
program, which is named for the late Campus Compact co-founder Frank Newman, is
supported by KPMG Foundation and Newman’s Own Foundation.

"UIC’s Lydia Diamond wins Horton Foote Playwriting Award | UIC Today Skip to main content Updated: Apr 24, 2020 at 05:12 PM UIC Logo Today Submit Campus News Academics & Research Events Resources Current Student Resources Faculty & Staff Resources Photography/Video Social Media Account Request Form UIC Social Media Guidelines and Best Practices COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions What you need to know about COVID-19 Support for the UIC community (COVID-19) Teaching, learning and working resources In the News: COVID-19 Contact Communicating On Campus Sending Announcements / DDDH UIC Social Media Directory UIC’s Lydia Diamond wins Horton Foote Playwriting Award April 22, 2020 Lydia Diamond, playwright and UIC clinical associate professor of theatre. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Lydia Diamond grew up moving frequently as her single mother’s musical and academic teaching career took her from one university to another. During this time, her mother also earned advanced degrees and taught future artists. Diamond came from a family of musicians and educators, so she had been required to take violin lessons from the time she was 6. In high school, she managed to convince her mother to let her put down the violin in favor of letting the theatre be her mode of artistic expression. After earning an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University and spending a decade performing professionally, she realized that her true calling was as a playwright. Diamond, UIC clinical associate professor of theatre in the School of Theatre and Music within the College of Architecture, Design, and the Arts, was recently named the recipient of the 2020 Horton Foote Playwriting Award. The award comes with a $25,000 prize that will be awarded in July. She has nine published plays including her latest work, “Toni Stone,” which was critically acclaimed, and named Critic’s Pick by the New York Times.  In addition to “Toni Stone,” her plays include “Smart People,” “Stick Fly,” “Harriet Jacobs,” “Voyeurs de Venus,” “The Gift Horse,” “The Inside,” and her adaptation of Toni Morrison’s novel, “The Bluest Eye.” She also has written for television. She recently spoke about her life and career and how UIC helps inform her writing. Tell us how you feel about winning the Horton Foote award? It’s so exciting, I don’t win a lot of awards so when I saw, “Congratulations” on the subject line of an email I thought, “Oh right, it’ll be something like, ‘Congratulations you have won an opportunity to buy a book,’ or some such. Then I opened it and it was real… and I kept reading, the news got better and better. I was teaching a class in about five minutes, and so after my mom and my boyfriend, the first people who knew were my UIC students. I lived in Texas when I was in high school, so I have an affection for Horton Foote in general and am a great admirer of his work. To receive an award in his name is a great honor. How did you get into playwriting and how many plays have you written? I’ve written about 12 plays, nine of them have been published and are produced regularly. I started playwriting in college. I went to Northwestern and was one of only two theatre majors of color at the time. There just weren’t many roles available to me, so I started writing my own material, writing one-woman shows and plays. At that time in Chicago (I think it’s not so different now), you could find a space in which to produce a show, call yourself a theatre company, send out a press release, and reviewers would actually come and review the work.  I worked in this place, Café Voltaire, where I was a cook, a waitress, a hostess and the manager of this little theater space in the basement.  That’s where I produced my first shows. Ironically that’s where, over two decades ago, I first met Yasen Peyankov, head of UIC’s Theater Department. He was directing a production of “Macbeth” there. Roundabout Theatre Company’s “Toni Stone.” (Photo: Joan Marcus) What are the themes that you go back to and why? Most of my work deals with themes of class, race and gender. I think it’s because I have always written about the things that are hard for us to talk about; things that confound and/or disgust or continue to shock me. I’m an African American woman, and I move through a world that has a relationship with African American people that is deeply problematic. I’m always amazed at how hard it is for all of us — people of all races — to talk about these things. I work out my questions and I work out trying to figure it out in my plays. It doesn’t mean that I’m writing political plays that are didactic and only about that. I’m writing plays that are about families and I’m writing plays about interesting historical figures and I’m writing plays about contemporary people of various ethnicities, sexual orientations, and classes. People who look like the folks I interact with daily. If you are a person of color, this is the world you are navigating. So, those themes are always going to come up in my work. Which is the latest play that is being produced and how does it fit into your overall anthology? It is “Toni Stone.” It took four years to write and is the true story about the first woman of any race to play in a professional baseball game when she played with the Indianapolis Clowns of the professional Negro Leagues. It started at the Roundabout Theater in New York. The American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco just put up its second production, also directed by Pam MacKinnon. Sadly, because of COVID-19, it closed the day after its opening. What’s great is that they’ve taped it and are making tickets for patrons to purchase and view online. It’s slated to be done at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., if we’re back to business as usual by July. I’ve just heard that there are about 10 productions of it around the country for the following season. The New York production of ‘Toni Stone’ garnered very good reviews. How does that make you feel? Throughout my career, my New York reviews were often not as flattering as the ones from other cities around the country. This is my first experience with critical raves in New York. It’s so very exciting, but I was also astounded and concerned because I didn’t realize how much of an impact it would have on the success of the play in every way. The industry needs to look at the ecology of the American theatre, which puts so much emphasis on the opinions of one or two reviewers in New York, to be the arbiters of what happens to the future of that play. They have the power to affect the number of future productions that a play might have, and its financial viability in general. So, yes, it felt wonderful to get raves across the board, AND, yes, it is all very arbitrary and a bit like winning the lottery when it happens. April Mathis in Roundabout Theatre Company’s production of “Toni Stone.” (Photo: Joan Marcus) Since you were a theater major as an undergrad, are you still an actor? Good God no! No, no, no. I’m not. It just took me a long time to realize that. I majored in acting and you spend a lot of time convincing your family that you’ll be OK. I learned now, as I’ve gotten older, I have ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) and my brain doesn’t want to hold on to lines. I seriously struggled my whole acting career to just learn my lines, which means I never really got to act because I couldn’t fully immerse myself in the character; so much of my attention went to trying to remember my lines. Though I was working steadily, I was miserable and expecting to be fired. It was awful. My then-husband was like, “It doesn’t seem like you like acting.” And I thought, ‘Oh, wow, that’s true. I don’t have to do this.’ By that time, my playwriting career had taken off. It was just a matter of saying to myself and then to people, ‘I’m a playwright.’ As opposed to saying, ‘I’m an actor, and I write plays.’ It was very liberating. What do you teach at UIC and what words of advice can you give students about writing for theater? I teach Playwriting, Script Analysis, a class called Contemporary Performance Techniques, in which people create their own work and we put on a show at the end of the semester. I tell my students to just write. Write as much as they can, all the time without judging themselves and their writing. I think it’s important that you don’t turn to other people for affirmation about what you do and how you do it (another issue I have with the reality of reviews). You write because you have stories to tell that are interesting but we have a tendency to think, ‘I’m not really a playwright unless I have a show at the Goodman Theatre, or I’m not really a playwright unless I have a show on Broadway.’ It took me 22 years of a successful playwriting career before I had a show on Broadway. If you think you’re writing so you can have certain kinds of accolades, you’ll lose your mind. There are too few opportunities and too many people who are good artists, for us to let the opinions of others dictate our artistic viability. Sure, you send a play out to theatres in hopes that it will be produced one day, but in the meantime, you must make a way for yourself. You write the play, then you find a church, or the basement of a vegetarian restaurant, or the back of a bar, recruit some of your friends, invite people to see it, and that’s being successful in the theater. How has UIC helped you achieve your goals and your dreams? Our students inspire me daily. I love them! They have incredible work ethics and a great deal of talent. Refreshingly, our students are lacking in something that I have seen at universities that cater to more economically privileged students. Our students tend not to indulge in ‘Am I talented enough?’ neurosis. They’re like, ‘I’m here to learn, and I’m working very hard to be here. Teach me.’ The prevailing attitude is: ‘Let’s go, let’s do this,’ and that is inspiring to me. Also, UIC is the first place I’ve ever worked where the students are wonderfully diverse, especially racially. I think that’s such a gift to the students and bodes well for our institution. They will leave UIC with a certain cultural fluency, a privilege that a lot of people just don’t have.

Photo:  Yanxiao Han and Petr Král SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus behind the COVID-19 pandemic,
infects cells by using its spike proteins to attach to proteins present on the
surfaces of certain human cells, also known as ACE2 receptors. Upon binding to
ACE2, the virus fuses with the host cell membrane and gains entry via this
attachment. Finding inhibitors that block key regions of the spike protein and
keep the virus from infecting cells is the focus of many scientists from around
world. At the University of Illinois at Chicago, researchers recently published a study in the journal ACS Nano that details findings from computer simulations seeking to identify these inhibitors, which eventually could assist chemists to develop new medicines to combat the coronavirus. Using a recently published X-ray crystal structure of the
receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 when it is bound to ACE2, the researchers
were able to identify 15 amino acids from ACE2 that interact directly with the
viral spike protein. Yanxiao Han, a UIC Ph.D. student in chemistry and first author on the paper, and Petr Král, UIC professor of chemistry, physics, biopharmaceutical sciences and chemical engineering, used computer modeling to design and assess four peptides that mimic the virus-binding domain of the human protein that allows SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells. Their molecular dynamics simulations revealed a double alpha helix
extracted from ACE2 as a highly stable peptide and potential defender from the
virus, capable of blocking the spike proteins. “A single alpha helix was not particularly stable,” said Král, senior author of the study. “So, the discovery that a pair of linked self-supporting helices can provide strong and stable binding was very exciting.” Han and Král hope that simple peptides might do the job of
healing the patients in later stages by slowing down the activity of the virus. “Such peptides might have limited secondary impact on the
organisms,” Král said. “These are not vaccines but possible therapeutics for
inhalation.” The peptides still need to be tested in the lab and in patients, but being able to narrow down drug candidates on the computer could help advance this process, according to the researchers. Han’s work related to the study is supported through the UIC
Graduate College Dean’s Scholar Fellowship.

UIC photo. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Special Collections and University Archives is launching a project to collect stories, photos, artwork and other current materials from the university community to document how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting life at UIC. The effort, dubbed Six Feet Apart: Stories from UIC during COVID-19, is a way to document history in the making as the world, the nation, municipalities and college institutions, including UIC, attempt to cope with this pandemic. As with past pandemics, the records created by these entities will be studied in the future. The University Library’s Special Collections and University Archives, the UIC Humanities in Medicine (HuMed) student group and the UIC College of Medicine are leading the effort to collect documentation that could aid future historians. This is important as journalists, bloggers and scholars have relied on historical documentation from the 1918 flu epidemic to garner lessons that help us in the present, said Megan Keller Young, special collections librarian. “This project is a way to capture personal reflections, which are all too often missing from the historical record,” said Keller Young. “This is a historical event all of us are going through together, but no one in quite the same way. All of these experiences should be documented for future researchers.” The organizers are asking current UIC students, faculty and staff to share their stories and experiences of how their lives have been impacted by COVID-19. The submissions will be preserved in the University Library’s Special Collections and University Archives, where they will be publicly available to students, researchers and other visitors to the library. Submissions can be written accounts, videos, photos and more. Selected materials eventually will be included in a digital exhibit chronicling the current pandemic. It’s important to document how quickly and dramatically everything has changed in a “blink of the eye,” said UIC medical student Chioma Ndukwe, one of the leaders of the History/Ethics subcommittee for HuMed. She said the humanities have always served to document the “how and why” of history. “Everyone has been working hard during this crisis — health care workers, IT techs, professors, students, maintenance workers and many more,” Ndukwe said. “I wanted those efforts to be documented; that way people years or even decades in the future can look back and learn from and about our experiences today.” UIC students, staff, and faculty are being asked to provide details on their day-to-day lives such as how they are coping with the transition to online learning, how graduating students are impacted by the pandemic in their final year, how their future employment prospects are also affected and the challenges of working from home. The project organizers especially hope to collect the experiences of those working in the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System. To submit their stories and experiences, UIC students, staff and faculty should use the submission form where they may contribute as much detail about themselves as they wish. Though they must provide an email address in case they need to be contacted by library staff, submissions can be anonymized when added to the collection.

Please join your fellow UIC students, faculty, and staff in our virtual “clean up” via the Litterati app, and develop a zero-waste policy for your department, unit, student organization or residence hall. While sharing your support for a plastic-free university on social media, we also encourage you to wear red instead of green. Besides showing some UIC-colored pride for the Zero Waste accomplishments we’ve made so far, we’re sounding the alarm on the climate crisis. Share your support for a Plastic-Free UIC.

Photo: Joshua Clark. University of Illinois at Chicago senior Anis Barmada is one of 49 international students to win the prestigious Gates Cambridge Scholarship for graduate studies at the University of Cambridge. Barmada, a UIC Honors College member majoring in biological sciences and chemistry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, was selected in the highly competitive selection process, which emphasizes outstanding academic achievement and social leadership. The newly elected international cohort joins more than two dozen scholars from the U.S., who were announced in February, to complete the Gates Cambridge class of 2020. The
prestigious scholarship, which aims to build a global network of future leaders
committed to improving the lives of others, is funded by the Gates Cambridge
Trust established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Barmada, who grew up in Damascus,
Syria, and immigrated to the U.S. in 2015, will
pursue a master’s degree in genomic medicine in the department of
medical genetics in the School of Clinical Medicine at Cambridge. “I hope to visualize the molecular, analytical, statistical, social and clinical challenges facing the use of omics-based personalized medicine across everyday clinics,” he said. “Professionally, I intend to pursue an MD/Ph.D. advancing biochemical and computational technologies to address currently incurable diseases and contributing to the crafting of a new era of health care without disparities.” Barmada, who
is minoring in mathematics, is part of the President’s Award Program STEM
Initiative at UIC, which is a selective peer and faculty network for students
in STEM disciplines to do research, develop professional connections and
prepare for graduate education. Since his first year at UIC, he
has conducted research on diabetic eye disease in the laboratory of Scott
Shippy, UIC associate professor of chemistry and bioengineering, while also
volunteering at an ophthalmology clinic that serves patients of the same
life-changing, blindness-causing disease conditions. “Through
these experiences, I found an articulation of my interests in patient-driven
research that considers both the biochemical and socioeconomic lenses,” he
said. Shippy considers Barmada “nothing short of remarkable” and, as an example, noted his key role in the lab’s project to collect tears from mice to look for markers of disease that resulted in two first-author publications from the young researcher. “He has grown tremendously from those first days learning the basic lab techniques to the present day with a research-oriented opinion article under review in an ophthalmology journal,” Shippy said. “With his intellect and astounding work ethic, I predict he will have a large impact on the future of health care as a scientist-physician.” The Gates Cambridge Scholarship is the latest honor for Barmada, who earned a prestigious Goldwater scholarship in 2019 and was among the U.S. finalists for a 2020 Rhodes Scholarship. He is the recipient of several scholarships and awards, in addition to research support via Honors College research grants, the Liberal Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Initiative and the chemistry department’s Herbert E. Paaren Summer Research Stipend. Barmada, a resident of Mount Prospect and 2016 graduate of Wheeling High School, is the fifth UIC student to win a Gates Cambridge Scholarship since the program was established through a $210 million donation from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. UIC’s Office of External Fellowships provides advising and assistance
to current undergraduate and professional school students in finding and
applying for a range of nationally and internationally competitive fellowships,
scholarships and grants.

"UIC John Marshall's Intellectual Property and Practical Training Programs Rated Among Nation's Best | UIC JMLS News and Publications Chicago Law School, The John Marshall Law School, Chicago Illinois -- legal education Menu MENU MENU Home Student News Faculty News Alumni News ALUMNI PROFILES CLASS NOTES WHY I GIVE Campus News Follow us: UIC John Marshall’s Intellectual Property and Practical Training Programs Rated Among Nation’s Best Written by The John Marshall Law School | Apr 22, 2020 Specialty programs at UIC John Marshall Law School in Chicago have once again been rated among the nation’s best . This is the sixth time preLaw Magazine rated UIC John Marshall as one of the top law schools in the country for its practical training program and its intellectual property law program was recognized for the fifth time. UIC John Marshall received an A+ rating in intellectual property and a B+ in practical training. The grades were based on the Law School’s curricular offerings in comparison to the offerings of the other 200+ law schools across the nation. “This year’s recognition continues an eighty-year tradition of offering our students the best quality IP education available, said Daryl Lim, Director of UIC John Marshall’s Center for Intellectual Property, Information & Privacy Law. “Law students aspiring to an IP-focused career, as well as law and non-law students aspiring to specialize in other areas, know the UIC John Marshall experience offers them an important competitive advantage. With the steadfast support of the university and Law School, we strive not only to observe the IP world around us but also to continue to be a constructive player in it.” Each year, UIC John Marshall’s Center for Intellectual Property, Information & Privacy Law offers dozens of courses focused on IP, information technology or privacy law. Additionally, UIC John Marshall offers LLMs for practicing attorneys and Master of Jurisprudence concentrations for non-attorneys, in intellectual property or information technology & privacy law. Additionally, UIC John Marshall requires more practical training than many other law schools in the nation. The Law School requires all law students to complete three credits – a minimum of 156 hours – of an externship or clinical experience. Students can further refine their lawyering skills by enrolling in a second semester of an advanced clinic. All students must also take four semesters of legal writing and drafting courses. UIC John Marshall’s legal writing program is known for its rigorous research and writing requirements and was ranked seventh best in the nation and the best in the Midwest by U.S. News & World Report. The Law School also houses the largest in-school writing resource center in the country. Each year, the students and faculty at UIC John Marshall’s Community Legal Clinics donate thousands of hours of services to individuals and communities in the Chicago area. The clinics provide services across a wide range of practice areas including community and business development; fair housing; veterans benefits; international human rights; civil rights; patent; and trademark law. The Law School’s clinical opportunities offer students a chance to develop real legal experience while still in school. All clinics are designed to develop the practice-ready skills that employers seek in career applicants. Alicia Alvarez, Associate Dean for Experiential Education, described the clinics and externship program as “a unique opportunity for students to explore the role of the lawyer in the supportive environment of the Law School while also exploring the lawyer’s responsibility for access to justice.” Related Posts Alumni Newsletter Professor Jones Appears on ABC News ...

Further, federal regulations require institutions of higher education to disclose information for filing complaints. The information below is intended to provide both institutional and external contact information to current and prospective students. Academic Concerns Students are encouraged to contact their college office to seek advice. The Student Handbook , the undergraduate catalog , and the graduate catalog provide guidance on campus-level policy. If complaints cannot be resolved at the college level or with the help of Student Ombuds Service (see below), the formal mechanism to register student complaints is through the Student Academic Grievance Procedures . They define an administrative process through which students may seek resolution of complaints or grievances regarding academic standing during their enrollment at UIC. Examples of complaints addressed by this process include but are not limited to grade disputes and program dismissals. Note that these procedures may not be used for decisions made as a result of the Student Conduct Process, described below. Other Complaints If a complaint cannot be resolved within the college or the student prefers to speak to someone outside of the college, students have access to several services within the Office of the Dean of Students (DOS). The Student Ombuds Service within the Office of the Dean of Students provides an impartial advocate for fairness who investigates student complaints. The Ombudsperson may serve as a counselor, go-between, mediator, or informal fact finder. Some of the matters which may be addressed by this service include grade disputes / grievance procedures, student record errors, billing / financial issues and registration problems. The Student Conduct Process within the Office of the Dean of Students is also available to any student, university employee, or community member with a complaint about a UIC student. They can file a student misconduct incident report or academic integrity incident report form regarding possible violations of the University Standards of Conduct, which is included in the Student Disciplinary Policy . The Office for Access and Equity strives to increase access to employment, programs, and services in an environment free of unlawful discrimination and harassment. As part of the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) is the office charged with reviewing and addressing complaints of harassment and/or discrimination. This includes sex discrimination, sexual misconduct, sexual harassment and retaliation. Students may file a complaint internally using the established reporting process on the OAE website . UIC is committed to maintaining a barrier-free environment so that individuals with disabilities can fully access programs, services, and all activities at UIC. Students with complaints or concerns about accessibility issues on campus can submit an Online Report of UIC Accessibility Issues available at the UIC Disability Resources website . The Disability Resource Center (DRC) receives these reports and follows up with different units on campus based on the nature of the complaint. If the student experiences discrimination based on disability it should be reported directly to the Office of Access and Equity (OAE). External Resources If a student's complaint cannot be resolved by the University, a complaint may be filed with the Illinois Board of Higher Education , which regulates higher education institutions in Illinois, through their Complaint System ; or the student may contact the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) , UIC's regional accrediting agency, through their Complaint Process . Online Education Complaint Resolution Students enrolled in Online or Distance Education courses are encouraged to contact their respective college office to seek advice. Since the University of Illinois at Chicago has been approved as an institutional participant in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) initiative by the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC-SARA), students enrolled from participating SARA states, as indicated by the State Authorization webpage , follow the SARA Complaint Resolution Process . Such students may contact the Illinois Board of Higher Education (the Illinois SARA portal agency) with complaints that were not resolved through the student campus complaint procedures described above by accessing the IBHE online complaint system . Students enrolled in programs in states outside of SARA contact their own state agencies with complaints that were not resolved through the student UIC campus complaint procedures described above. Online students with questions about complaint procedures may also contact UIC Extended Campus at onlineinfo@uic.edu or at (312) 355-0423 . Listed below are the state agencies for states or U.S. territories not currently participating in SARA. California California Bureau of Private Postsecondary Education PO Box 980818 W.

UIC prohibits and will not tolerate Sexual Misconduct of or by students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC will take prompt and fair action to eliminate such conduct, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects through interim protective measures and accommodations, equitable investigations, and disciplinary processes. Employees and students in violation of this policy may face sanctions up to and including termination or expulsion. The Office for Access and Equity, through its Title IX Coordinator, has the authority to conduct investigations, to determine when there have been violations of this policy based on the standard of preponderance of evidence, and then make recommendations in accordance with the relevant University policies for students, employees, patients, or visitors. UIC encourages good faith reports of Sexual Misconduct and prohibits retaliation against any person who reports Sexual Misconduct and/or who participates in a Title IX investigation or resultant disciplinary process. All employees are considered to be “Responsible Employees” with the authority and responsibility to report Sexual Misconduct to University Officials.  Employees who are exempted from this reporting requirement are professional or pastoral counselors who provide work-related mental-health counseling, campus advocates who provide confidential victim assistance, and employees who are otherwise prohibited by law from disclosing information received in the course of providing professional care and treatment. Reason for Policy : To ensure that UIC is compliant with federal and state laws related to sex discrimination, which includes sexual violence, Sexual Misconduct, and sexual and gender-based harassment. This policy updates the existing policy to mandate that the University’s faculty and staff report incidents involving Sexual Misconduct to the Title IX coordinator. Minority Impact Statement: The policy does not have any disproportionate or unique impact on UIC’s minority students, staff, or faculty. Who Should Read the Policy: All students, faculty, staff, and administrators at UIC. Definitions : Sexual Misconduct : According to federal Title IX regulations, unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex includes: (a) sexual harassment, (b) gender-based harassment, which is unwelcome conduct based on actual or perceived sex, or harassment based on gender identity or nonconformity with sex stereotypes, and/or (c) all forms of sexual violence including, but not limited to, sexual assault, sexual battery, sexual abuse, sexual coercion, sexual exploitation, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking (collectively referred to as “Sexual Misconduct”). Sexual misconduct is the term used in this policy to encompass unwanted or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is committed without valid consent. Also included in this term is any abusive behavior that arises out of an actual or perceived intimate relationship (e.g. domestic or dating violence and stalking). Sexual misconduct may occur between people of the same gender or different gender identifications. University : Refers to UIC. Procedures : Procedures, reporting options, and resources are outlined on the UIC Office for Access and Equity Website . Students may review the Student Sexual Misconduct website . Related Laws, Regulations, Statutes, and Policies: Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (“Title IX”), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended (“Title VII”), 2013 VAWA amendments to the Clery Act, the Clery Act, the Illinois Preventing Sexual Violence in Higher Education Act, the Illinois Human Rights Act, and related UIC and University of Illinois System policies.",https://oae.uic.edu/policies/sexual-misconduct-policy/,"Prohibition of Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment and Sexual Misconduct | Office for Access and Equity | University of Illinois at Chicago"

Introduction About Us The Black Tech Scholars Program started from an honest dialogue regarding racial and gender disparities in the technology sector that later cultivated into a full fledged partnership between private and public entities committed to providing young people of color with the opportunity to acquire transferable professional development skills and gain hands-on experiential learning opportunities. Our goal is to provide opportunities for African American students to learn technical and professional skills that will give them the tools they need to pursue careers in the modern workplace. By providing these opportunities for our scholars, we can change the landscape of the tech workforce demographic and create a more inclusive environment. We continue to find ways to assist our scholars experience in their pursuits to gain relevant technical skills that can eventually prepare them for careers within the tech industry. In addition to the weekly courses, our scholars have an opportunity to engage in the following activities: • Connect directly with professionals in the field to build their networks and obtain mentorship • Actively participate in design sprint-like events (Hack-a-thon) in which computer programmers and others involved in software development collaborate intensively on software projects • Complete a culminating project in which scholars design and develop websites for local community organizations • Attend career fairs, networking events and forums in order to research career possibilities, network with prospective employers, make and obtain a first impression with potential employers and clients.",https://bts.uic.edu/,AAAN Black Tech Scholars Program | University of Illinois at Chicago

We pursue this goal in two ways: by recruiting students who reflect a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds and by providing programs that ensure the academic and professional success of students who choose UIC. What do we mean by diversity? At UIC, we take a broad view of diversity. Demographic diversity is important to us, and it is reflected among our student, faculty, and administrators. Going further, we also feel that diversity represents “the totality of the ways that people are similar and different,” to quote a university document that guides our thinking on the subject. This means we seek to develop a community that is inclusive by race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation and identity, disability, national origin and citizenship status, age, language, culture, religion, and economic status. These criteria hold special importance in cases when similarities and differences within them are used in our society as a basis for unfair advantage and inequity. Our concept of diversity generally focuses on “identity” as an organizing principle. UIC recognizes that people develop personal and collective identities based on the resonance that they perceive with various elements of their own background and the world around them. Our goal is that all of our students feel respected, fully empowered to be themselves in a welcoming environment, and, centrally to our purpose as an institution, prepared to thrive in the world of engineering. No matter who you are or where you come from, UIC is a place you can call home . About UIC diversity #13 UIC's rank in U.S. News & World Report for campus diversity 83% of freshmen call diversity a key element of why they chose UIC 25% of first-year students report having a first language other than English Diversity programming These are some of the programs that allow us to recruit a diverse student community and prepare students for success in engineering: President’s Award Program: A four-year scholarship program that promotes student success and academic excellence in collaboration with the entire UIC community. The program includes a Summer College and First-Year Experience along with special opportunities such as undergraduate research, study abroad, specialized seminars, and career and graduate/professional school preparation. S-STEM Scholars: With support from the National Science Foundation, the College of Engineering provides four-year partial scholarships, academic support, and one-on-one career mentoring to talented undergraduate students whose families face economic challenges. The program has a 94-percent retention rate, and its first group of students has an average GPA of 3.5. Supplemental instruction: This is a “for students, by students” tutoring program that covers a variety of required engineering courses. Led by students who succeeded in that particular course, sessions include instruction, study techniques, and supplementary test preparation. Student organizations open to all: The College of Engineering is home to organizations such as the National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Arab American Association of Engineers and Architects, Women in Engineering, and Veterans in Engineering, all of which contribute to a greater sense of belonging and community. The best part? All of these organizations are open to anyone, regardless of background, setting the stage for student activities that reflect the full spectrum of who we are.

For most students, the road to Expo begins in the Senior Design course , a two-semester sequence that allows seniors to gather all the knowledge and skills they’ve acquired at UIC Engineering and put them to work to solve a real-world design problem. The projects our seniors take on range from the practical to the fantastic. Recent projects have explored creating biodiesel from coffee grounds, building devices to improve surgery, designing an HVAC system for a four-story building, conducting traffic analyses for Chicago’s major highways, and recommending musical selections for people via facial-recognition technology. Seniors enter their projects into the annual Engineering Expo, a conference-style event where students showcase their work to peers, faculty members, and panels of judges who represent Chicago’s professional community. Beginning in 2019, computer science students also take part in Expo, exhibiting work they completed using Arduino.

Visit We are located on the first floor of SEO. The main undergraduate office is in Room 123. Important Advising Information Spring-semester advising for summer and fall courses All engineering students must meet with their faculty advisor prior to registering for the summer and fall terms. To ensure that these advising meetings take place, an “advising hold” is placed on each student’s record, and it will not be lifted to allow registration until the student and advisor have spoken. Students should follow the instructions set forth by the department in which they are majoring to make an appointment with their advisor. Undeclared majors whose last names begin with A through M should make an appointment with Letreurna Owens at (312) 996-9529 or lowens2@uic.edu, and undeclared majors with last names that begin with N through Z should make an appointment with Elena Diaz at (312) 355-5899 or ddiaz2@uic.edu. Appointments typically are made during the ninth week of the spring term, and the advising meetings themselves take place during the 10th week. Failure to see an advisor during this time may result in a delay in registration. Information on other key advising topics can be found in the sections below. my.uic.edu answer my.UIC.edu is a comprehensive resource for current students. It is a portal that gives you access to registration-related, financial, academic, and personal information. Use this portal to obtain class schedule and registration information and to log in to Blackboard and other university systems. iAdvise answer iAdvise is UIC’s integrated planning and advising system. It facilitates communication among advisors, integrates student success information, and incorporates Early Alerts to enhance advising and student success. Powered by Starfish, iAdvise will enhance the opportunity for advisors, faculty, student resources providers, and students to work together for success. Students, staff and faculty can access iAdvise through the my.uic.edu portal. Degree audit reports / uAchieve answer uAchieve is a UIC system that provides a degree audit report. This is an unofficial audit of your progress toward your degree that reflects courses completed and currently in progress. Viewing your uAchieve report in advance of your advising meeting—and bringing a copy with you—will make advising more productive. The uAchieve report can give your advisor a more complete picture of your accomplishments so far at UIC so that he or she can provide guidance on what lies ahead. You can access your report via the my.uic.edu portal. If you have questions about what is on your uAchieve report or feel that it is inaccurate, please email one of the Academic Resource Center staff (see directory on this page) so that they can review it and make any necessary changes. If you contact one of the counselors by email, please provide your UIN and be as specific as possible about what you believe is wrong with the report so that we can better understand the problem and get back to you in a timely manner. Physics placement test answer Students who plan to take PHYS 141 should be aware of the prerequisite and/or placement test requirement. The prerequisite to take PHYS 141 is a grade of C or better in MATH 180 or concurrent registration in this course and a grade of C or better in PHYS 100 or adequate performance on the physics placement test. The physics placement test assesses your capabilities in high school algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and word problems that require quantitative reasoning. No specific background in physics is required. Information about continuing student placement test reservations can be found on the UIC testing services website . Add/drop deadlines Adding a course Continuing students register for the next term during the early enrollment period. If you want to add a course to your schedule before the term begins, you may do so on a space-available basis until the Friday before the term begins. After the term has begun, adding a course is subject to these deadlines: Fall semester: Friday of week 2 Spring semester: Friday of week 2 Summer session: Friday of week 1 Beginning with the Monday of the second week of the fall and spring semesters , students may only add a course with the approval of the instructor. Beginning with the Monday of the second week of the summer session , students may not add a course at all. Exceptions to these deadlines are sometimes possible, but the request must be presented with written approval from the instructor to the College of Engineering undergraduate office, which will make the final decision. The undergraduate office may elect to deny the request even if the instructor has expressed support. In general, adding a course after the term begins is not recommended. You will have missed several days of instruction, you may not have the syllabus, you may have missed an initial assignment or quiz. Some students seek to add a course after the start of the term because it may seem to be the only way to get into courses that are in high demand, but it still may not be in your best interest. Dropping a course Continuing students register for the next term during the early enrollment period. If you want to drop a course from your schedule before the term begins, you may do so up until the Friday before the term begins. After the term has begun, you may still be able to drop a course by following these deadlines: Fall semester deadline: Friday of week 2 Spring semester deadline: Friday of week 2 Summer session deadline: Friday of week 1 Students who drop a course before the deadlines listed above will not have the course reflected in their record and will not receive a grade for the course. Students who drop a course after these periods receive a grade of W in the course in their record, but grades of W are not included in the calculation of a student’s grade point average. Exceptions to the add and drop deadlines As noted above, engineering students may drop a class through the Friday of the second week of the fall and spring semesters and through the Friday of the first week of the summer session without any penalty. In addition, all undergraduate students receive four opportunities over the course of their entire UIC enrollment to drop a course without penalty between the third and 10th weeks of the fall and spring semesters or between the second and fifth weeks of the summer session. These four “late drops” will be approved, regardless of the circumstances, provided that the student submits a Late Drop Petition Form to the COE front office (123 SEO) within the designated period and that the student has not exceeded the four-opportunity limit. Requests to drop a course after the 10th week of the fall and spring semesters (or after the fifth week of the summer session) and requests to exceed the limit of four late drops are not routinely granted unless there are documented exceptional circumstances outside of the student’s control. Such requests require a written petition and are reviewed by the dean. Poor performance in a course is not a sufficient reason to justify approval of a request. Because of the limitations on dropping classes, students are advised to evaluate their academic standing in the course with the instructor before requesting to exercise one of the four allowable late drops. Withdrawing from UIC A university withdrawal is a process by which all courses for the term are dropped and an entry of W is made for each course on the transcript. You may withdraw from the university at any time from the first day of instruction through the last day of instruction in each term, conditional on not having earned a final grade in any course. After the 15th week of the semester (or after the seventh week in the summer session), the college requires verification that the conditions for withdrawal have been met. Students contemplating a university withdrawal are advised to meet with an academic advisor. Repeating a course with GPA recalculation answer The current policy for repeating courses depends on when you were admitted to UIC Engineering. Students admitted for fall 2017 going forward are bound by the university’s repeat policy for standard graded courses . Students admitted for summer 2017 or earlier are governed by the following policy: For classes taken at UIC from fall 2009 forward, you can petition for a Grade Point Average recalculation for up to four total courses during your studies at UIC. You must declare your intent to have this recalculation by the end of the second week of classes in the fall or spring semester, or by the end of the first week of classes in the summer session. Petition forms for this purpose will be available on the student resources page during the times of year when they can be filed. More information on this policy is available on the UIC registrar’s website . Taking a course credit / no credit answer Certain courses in the College of Engineering may be taken “credit/no credit.” Through this option, a student may be allowed to complete a limited number of courses with a grade of credit (CR) or no credit (NC) instead of a letter grade. Important: courses below the 200 level, required courses, and essential prerequisite courses cannot be taken as credit/no credit. In addition, certain courses cannot be taken credit/no credit due to the policies of the departments that offer them. For detailed information on the credit/no credit option, please inquire in the College of Engineering undergraduate office, 123 SEO. Students also should check with the department that offers the course they want to take credit/no credit to make sure that it is eligible under this policy. Please verify with the department before you visit the undergraduate office. In addition, make sure you check your record for any holds that may prevent you from registering. You can find this information on the my.uic.edu portal. Remember that all engineering students will have an advising hold placed on their record in each spring semester until they speak with their advisor. Student responsibilities answer As a student, you are responsible for knowing and adhering to all university and College of Engineering policies, deadlines, and procedures. Avoid potential enrollment and registration problems by carefully reading university and college rules and regulations regarding registration and add/drop of courses. You can receive credit only for those courses for which you are properly registered. Likewise, you assume academic and financial responsibility for any course for which you register unless you officially cancel or withdraw your registration according to the deadlines that are published by the university. As a precaution, you should verify your schedule at three key points: prior to the first day of classes, before the add/drop deadline (the end of the second week of classes), and prior to the late-drop deadline (the end of the 10th week of classes). Schedule of classes answer The schedule of classes is published by the university. You can access the schedule search portal here . Graduation check and ""Intent to Graduate"" answer During the semester before you intend to graduate, you should request a graduation check by submitting a graduation check form . This will give you time to address any issues with degree requirements. We also suggest you view your Degree Audit Report on the my.uic.edu portal. To declare your intent to graduate, you will need to submit an Intent to Graduate form online at my.uic.edu . The submission deadline for the Intent to Graduate form is the Friday of the third week of the fall and spring semesters or the second week of the summer session.

If you are an applicant and have a question that is not answered below, please contact UIC's undergraduate admissions office for assistance. If you are a current student and have a question that is not answered below, please contact the College of Engineering at 312-996-3463 or via email at uic-engr@uic.edu Admissions-Related Questions What's the best way to learn about UIC Engineering? answer If you are able to, visit us! The UIC undergraduate admissions office maintains a schedule of special visit days geared for interested students. If you cannot see us in person, this website—and the websites of our six academic departments—are great places to start. You can find our department sites here: Bioengineering Chemical engineering Civil and materials engineering Computer science Electrical and computer engineering Mechanical and industrial engineering What kind of high school preparation is best for engineering? answer To succeed in the engineering program at UIC, you will need to take at least three and a half years of high school math and at least two years of high school laboratory science, such as biology, chemistry, and/or physics. Ideally, students will have taken four years of math and four years of lab science, including some courses at the Advanced Placement level, if that is offered by the high school. If I don't qualify for engineering right after high school, can I still pursue it? answer Absolutely! Some students do not decide on their future path until they are already in college. If you are already at UIC in another college (for example, if you start here in the College of Liberal Arts or the College of Business), you can complete what’s called an inter-college transfer to change over to the College of Engineering. Another option is to begin your undergraduate education at another institution and then apply to UIC in a later semester as a transfer student . You can use UIC’s online transfer guides to help you determine the courses you will need and what will be expected of you if you’re admitted to UIC at a particular point in your education. If you choose the transfer path, we encourage you to let us know so that we can help you along in your courses and schedules. You may be at a different school, but if you are planning to attend UIC Engineering, we still consider you a part of the family and want to get to know you! When are the application deadlines and the deadlines for UIC housing? answer Application deadlines are set by the UIC admissions office and vary based on what kind of applicant you are (for example, a first-year applicant, a transfer applicant, an international applicant, and so on). All application-related deadlines are on the admissions office website . You can find information on housing deadlines—and the application you need to submit—on the UIC Housing website. How important is the ACT or SAT? Do I need to take both? answer All new first-year students must submit either an ACT or SAT score. The choice of which test to take is up to you. You do not need to take both. We prefer that the test scores be sent directly from ACT or the College Board, but we will accept a test score printed on the official high school transcript. The admissions office will use the highest ACT composite score or SAT total score (from a single test session) that is on file when the admission decision is made. If a student has taken the SAT, verbal and math scores will be added and converted to reflect the ACT equivalent. How is class rank used in engineering admissions? answer We use a formula to convert a student’s class rank to a percentile. It is: [(class size – class rank) / class size] x 100 If your school does not rank its students, your school can enclose a note to that effect with your transcript. If your school supplies two ranks based on weighted and unweighted grades, we will use the higher rank. Applicants who rank below the 30th percentile are not eligible for admission regardless of their standardized test score. How long will it take me to graduate? answer The UIC Engineering curriculum is designed to be completed in four years. This can be accomplished if you take heavy course loads and/or attend summer semesters, or if you have AP credit that will help you place into higher courses as an incoming student. The average time to graduation for most of our students, however, is five years. Unlike other majors that require 120 hours of coursework to graduate, the College of Engineering requires 128 hours. We also understand that many of our students maintain jobs or internships outside of school, or that they want to take fewer courses to concentrate on earning higher grades, either of which may extend their expected graduation. No matter what, we are happy to work with you to make sure you succeed in a time frame that makes sense for your schedule and goals. Transfer-Related Questions What are the transfer courses I need for admission? answer Minimum course requirements for transfer admission currently include completion of at least Calculus I with a grade of C or better. For transfer applicants who plan to major in computer science, completion of a computer science course equivalent to CS 111 is also required prior to admission. While not required, it is highly recommended that you complete the following courses prior to starting here as a transfer student: English Composition I and II Calculus I, II and III Differential Equations Physics I and II (calculus-based) Chemistry I (or, for computer science applicants, one course in either Biology of Cells and Organisms, Biology of Populations and Communities, or Introduction to Earth Science I or II) The reason we recommend these courses is that many of them are prerequisites for other engineering courses you will take as part of your program. Completing them before you begin as a transfer student at UIC is very beneficial. Please note that admission requirements are subject to change based on the number of applications received or the capacity available in individual majors. In addition, courses in which grades of D or lower are earned will not be applied toward the degree. What are the prerequisite courses for engineering? answer Prerequisites are courses that lay important groundwork for the upper-level engineering courses you will take in the future. Prerequisites include: English Composition I and II Calculus I, II and III Differential Equations Physics I and II (calculus-based, covering mechanics and electricity/magnetism) Chemistry I (or, for computer science applicants, one course in either Biology of Cells and Organisms, Biology of Populations and Communities, or Introduction to Earth Science I or II) You can take these courses at any accredited two-year or four-year college or university, which may be the institution you are transferring from. If you do not complete these courses at your first undergraduate institution, another option is to take them at UIC through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. After you have completed these courses in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences with the necessary grades, you can complete an inter-college transfer to the College of Engineering. How can I find out which of my courses will transfer? answer UIC works with a service called Transferology that helps students to determine which courses taken at their home institution will be accepted at UIC. All you need to do is visit the Transferology website and create a free account to use this service. The website will walk you through a comparison of the courses you’ve taken at your current school and the requirements in place at UIC. Do transfer students need to take placement tests for certain courses? answer Students who have completed a course equivalent to Calculus I, English Composition I, and Physics I do not need to take a placement test in those subjects. Students who intend to take chemistry at UIC must take the chemistry placement test. This includes students who have not studied chemistry previously and students with any amount of transfer credit in general chemistry or other area of chemistry. Students who intend to take a foreign language course at UIC should contact the college office to discuss whether a placement test is necessary. If I want to be admitted as a transfer, what grades do I need? answer UIC Engineering considers your math and science course grades a priority. Even though humanities and social sciences are extraordinarily important to your development as an individual, your math and science grades give us the critical information we need about your potential to succeed in engineering coursework. Therefore, in math and science, as well as cumulatively, we look for a GPA of at least 2.5 on a scale of 4.0 (or a GPA of 3.5 on a scale of 5.0). As a transfer student, how long will it take me to graduate? answer If you transfer to UIC from a community college, you should plan to spend two to three years completing requirements at UIC to graduate with a degree in engineering. If you transfer to UIC from a U.S. four-year college and have completed significant study in upper-level engineering courses that are comparable to ours, the minimum amount of study required at UIC is 30 semester hours. For all students, the minimum number of semester hours required for an engineering degree—including transfer courses that are accepted and courses you take at UIC—is 128. Due to the challenging nature of an engineering degree and the plentiful opportunities for UIC engineering students to obtain co-ops and internships, many students elect to extend their undergraduate study beyond the traditional four years that many people consider as the time required for a college degree. Current Student Questions What are the add-drop deadlines? answer Adding a course Continuing students register for the next term during the early enrollment period. If you want to add a course to your schedule before the term begins, you may do so on a space-available basis until the Friday before the term begins. After the term has begun, adding a course is subject to these deadlines: Fall semester: Friday of week 2 Spring semester: Friday of week 2 Summer session: Friday of week 1 Beginning with the Monday of the second week of the fall and spring semesters , students may only add a course with the approval of the instructor. Beginning with the Monday of the second week of the summer session , students may not add a course at all. Exceptions to these deadlines are sometimes possible, but the request must be presented with written approval from the instructor to the College of Engineering undergraduate office, which will make the final decision. The undergraduate office may elect to deny the request even if the instructor has expressed support. In general, adding a course after the term begins is not recommended. You will have missed several days of instruction, you may not have the syllabus, you may have missed an initial assignment or quiz. Some students seek to add a course after the start of the term because it may seem to be the only way to get into courses that are in high demand, but it still may not be in your best interest. Dropping a course Continuing students register for the next term during the early enrollment period. If you want to drop a course from your schedule before the term begins, you may do so up until the Friday before the term begins. After the term has begun, you may still be able to drop a course by following these deadlines: Fall semester deadline: Friday of week 2 Spring semester deadline: Friday of week 2 Summer session deadline: Friday of week 1 Students who drop a course before the deadlines listed above will not have the course reflected in their record and will not receive a grade for the course. Students who drop a course after these periods receive a grade of W in the course in their record, but grades of W are not included in the calculation of a student’s grade point average. Exceptions to the add and drop deadlines As noted above, engineering students may drop a class through the Friday of the second week of the fall and spring semesters and through the Friday of the first week of the summer session without any penalty. In addition, all undergraduate students receive four opportunities over the course of their entire UIC enrollment to drop a course without penalty between the third and 10th weeks of the fall and spring semesters or between the second and fifth weeks of the summer session. These four “late drops” will be approved, regardless of the circumstances, provided that the student submits a Late Drop Petition Form to the COE front office (123 SEO) within the designated period and that the student has not exceeded the four-opportunity limit. Requests to drop a course after the 10th week of the fall and spring semesters (or after the fifth week of the summer session) and requests to exceed the limit of four late drops are not routinely granted unless there are documented exceptional circumstances outside of the student’s control. Such requests require a written petition and are reviewed by the dean. Poor performance in a course is not a sufficient reason to justify approval of a request. Because of the limitations on dropping classes, students are advised to evaluate their academic standing in the course with the instructor before requesting to exercise one of the four allowable late drops. Withdrawing from UIC A university withdrawal is a process by which all courses for the term are dropped and an entry of W is made for each course on the transcript. You may withdraw from the university at any time from the first day of instruction through the last day of instruction in each term, conditional on not having earned a final grade in any course. After the 15th week of the semester (or after the seventh week in the summer session), the college requires verification that the conditions for withdrawal have been met. Students contemplating a university withdrawal are advised to meet with an academic advisor. What are the rules for academic probation and dismissal? answer The rules for academic probation and dismissal are spelled out in the College of Engineering section of the UIC catalog . Here is a summary: Academic probation Any student whose grade point average for any term falls below 2.00 on a scale of 4.00 but whose UIC cumulative grade point average is above 2.00 will be placed on “Probation Level 1” for the following term. The student will return to clear status if a grade point average of at least 2.00 is earned without any grade less than C in the following term. Any student whose UIC cumulative grade point average falls below 2.00 on a scale of 4.00 is placed on “Probation Level 2.” A student on Probation Level 2 is required to earn at least one B and no grade less than a C in each ensuing term until both the UIC cumulative grade point average and the total cumulative grade point average are above 2.00 out of 4.00. Dismissal A student on academic probation who does not meet the probationary requirements will be reviewed and could be dismissed from the university. A student who fails to make progress toward a degree may be dismissed. Examples of failure to make progress include excessive term deficit points (a total deficit score of -12 or worse in a given term), failure to complete required courses, accumulation of an excessive number of Incomplete (I) grades, failure to earn credit in any semester, and failure to maintain a 2.00 average in the major discipline. A student may be readmitted after the first dismissal with petition and presentation of above-satisfactory performance in college-level courses taken outside of UIC. The non-UIC work evaluated for readmission may or may not apply toward a UIC degree. Only in rare cases will a student be readmitted after a second dismissal. How are deficit points calculated? answer Deficit points are calculated to represent the amount that a student diverges below the average grade for a course, assuming that C is the baseline grade. If the “net” deficit points for any student in a given term are -12 or worse, that student can be dismissed from the College of Engineering for poor academic performance. For example, assume that a course has 3 credit hours. If the term grade is C, then the deficit points are zero. If the grade is D, then the student has a deficit of -1 (one grade below) the average of C. This deficit is multiplied by the number of credits carried by the course, in this case 3. The math then dictates that 3 x (-1) = -3. In another example, if the grade is F, the student has a deficit of -2 (two grades below) the average of C. The deficit points would be 3 x (-2) = -6. On the other side of the scale, grades of A and B contribute positively to the overall calculation for the term. A grade of B is one grade above the average, which, times three credits, yields  3 points. A grade of A is two grades above the average of C, which, times three credits, yields  6 points. Students whose term deficit points are -12 or worse can be dismissed from the College of Engineering even if they are not on academic probation. For students who are on probation, term deficit points are generally monitored for positive or negative trends in academic progress. How will I know if I am at risk of academic probation or dismissal? answer Students who are at risk of probation or dismissal will receive a communication from the college. This communication will lay out terms that are specific to the student’s case. What should I do if I have a complaint about a course or instructor? answer You should first make an appointment with the director of undergraduate studies in the academic department that oversees your major. If the issue remains unresolved after meeting with the department director of undergraduate studies and the department taking action, then you can bring the issue to the undergraduate office for consideration. I plan to graduate soon. Is there anything I need to know about? answer During the semester before you intend to graduate, you should request a graduation check by submitting a graduation check form . This will give you time to address any issues with degree requirements. We also suggest you view your Degree Audit Report on the my.uic.edu portal. To declare your intent to graduate, you will need to submit an Intent to Graduate form online at my.uic.edu . The submission deadline for the Intent to Graduate form is the Friday of the third week of the fall and spring semesters or the second week of the summer session.

For example, first-year students must maintain a 3.2 GPA in their first year at UIC and completing the Freshmen Engineering Success Program, a series of workshops and group projects that introduce you to your chosen major and teach you how to make the most of your existing math and science skills. The Guaranteed Paid Internship Program, or GPIP, as it is known, places students in paid positions in one of 42 UIC research labs and in other university departments. Students find out at the end of their first year whether they have qualified for the program and, if so, what their internship experience will be. Students describe GPIP as a significant force in accelerating their trajectory into future internships after their sophomore and junior years. The program reflects UIC Engineering’s commitment to helping our students lay the best possible groundwork for post-graduation career success. quote 1 My first internship through GPIP was in research, and the experience prepared me well for approaching new projects and positions.

To maintain the health and safety of the UIC community and the families that participate in our UIC Engineering Experience Camp, we regret that we have made the decision to cancel our camp for summer 2020. The university as a whole will only offer online instruction for summer 2020, as the world continues to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, and online instruction would not allow for the hands-on experiences and teamwork that are hallmarks of our camp. We plan to return with a bigger and better camp experience in summer 2021 that incorporates activities and experiences from all six UIC Engineering departments, so please bookmark this space and watch this page for updates. Thank you for your support of the UIC Engineering Experience Camp, and we hope to see you on campus in the future! Camp format UIC Engineering is home to multiple departments that represent different disciplines in engineering. In any given year, five of these departments participate in the camp, such as: Bioengineering Chemical engineering Computer science Electrical and computer engineering Mechanical and industrial engineering Each day, students get a chance to experiment—literally—with a particular field. Participants complete hands-on challenges based on concepts developed by UIC engineering faculty members. One day that might be writing computer code; another day, it could be robotics or biomechanics. Students also hear about potential future careers that might await them in each engineering discipline, from nanotechnology to self-driving vehicles to creating transplant-ready organs to save lives. Participants begin each day at UIC’s east campus and spend each of the five days of the camp in an engineering lab run by a different academic department. From morning drop-off to afternoon pickup, each participant is accompanied at all times by camp staff: faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate chaperones. All camp personnel are highly experienced and highly trained, and comprehensive background checks are performed to ensure the proper protection of minors. The expected participant-to-staff ratio is between 5 to 1 and 8 to 1. Cost and schedule Cost for 1 week: To be determined for summer 2021, when the camp is expected to return to operation. The fee includes daily lunch and a camp t-shirt. Children of University of Illinois (UIC, UIUC, UIS, or System Office) employees receive a 10 percent discount. Optional after-care from 4pm to 6pm is available for an additional $20 per day. Scholarships are available to assist families who have demonstrated financial need. Daily schedule (approximate — to be updated with exact info before summer 2021) 8:30am – 8:50am: Drop off at 801 S. Morgan St. (UIC Daley Library) 9am – 12pm: Project and design challenge #1, with short break 12pm – 1pm: Lunch and outdoor recess 1pm – 3pm: Project and design challenge #2 (and #3, if applicable), with short break 4pm: Pickup at 801 S. Morgan St. 4pm – 6pm: Optional after-care ($20 additional per day) Orientation information and other details are emailed to the parents/guardians of registered participants a few weeks before the camp start date. Is UIC Engineering Experience Camp for you? UIC mechanical and industrial engineering faculty member Yeow Siow calls the camp ideally suited for students who are “inquisitive and curious about the world around them, want to try new things, meet new people, and use their heads and hands to solve problems.” At UIC Engineering Experience Camp, students can discover the creative aspects of engineering while also getting a sense of what life is like as a college student.
