SPONSORS Current Research Turbulent Reacting Flow A flow solver based on high-order spectral element method is used with a pdf-based combustion model for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of subsonic and supersonic flows. The code is also used for Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). read more... Plasma Flow The main interest is in dusty plasma with particular application to nanoparticle coating. Various methods are used, including Particle-in-Cell (PIC) and fluid model, for simulation of charging, levitation and coating. read more... Electrostatic Atomization The mechanism of liquid atomization is significantly enhanced by injecting electric charge. Both experiments and simulations are used to develop a better understanding of the charging process and to apply this atomization method in practice. read more... Energy Storage and Conversion In our work we investigate chemistry, electro-chemistry and mechanics (elasto-plastic deformation) of secondary (rechargeable) batteries, together with the next-generation low temperature electrochemical energy conversion technologies. read more...
