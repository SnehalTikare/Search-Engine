<p>Further updates will be posted here as more services stabilize.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>On September 27, 2018 around 3:00PM, an unforeseen change caused the main acm.cs.uic.edu website to become inaccessible/slow. </p>

<p>Affected services:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The website: acm.cs.uic.edu.</li>
	<li>ACM Email may be delayed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At this time, acm.cs.uic.edu and related services should be back up.</strong>  A recent change by ACCC caused routing to be treated differently, causing some traffic to be routed out of incorrect interfaces.  These issues has since been resolved.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please let an ACM/LUG SysAdmin know by emailing sig-sysadmin [at] acm.cs.uic.edu or by messaging the #sig-sysadmin channel on Slack.</p>
