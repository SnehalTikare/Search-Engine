Since 2003, the program has transformed more than 50 underutilized areas on campus into comfortable and supportive learning environments. These informal learning spaces were designed and renovated with an emphasis on improving lighting, acoustics, and ergonomics. In addition to providing new, contemporary furniture and finishes, each Oasis is adorned with artwork created by UIC Art and Design students and alumni.
