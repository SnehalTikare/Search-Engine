Shatz Note to prospective graduate students: Since I am not currently active in research, I am not accepting new students to join my research. Research My broad research interests are in the areas of software engineering and distributed computing. I have special interest and expertise in distributed (concurrent) software development. Some specific research issues in this area include distributed software design, including partitioning and allocation algorithms; programming language constructs supporting distributed programming; techniques and tools for modeling and analysis of concurrent software systems, especially using Petri net-based models. My current research is also focused on design specifications for agent-based systems, fraud-detection (shilling behavior) in online auctions systems, and query processing in sensor networks aided by mobile objects.
