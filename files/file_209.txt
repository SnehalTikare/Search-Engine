Whether it is the water/wastewater system, the electricity grid, the building stock, or the transportation system, all are part of a nexus of co-dependent and ubiquitous elements of infrastructure that is vital to our cities. This network aspect of urban infrastructure is paramount and may hold the key for a more sustainable and resilient future. Research interests include: • Sustainable and Resilient Urban Infrastructure Planning • Transport, Water, Electricity, Building Energy Modeling • Complexity Science • Infrastructure Network Design • Network Science • Machine Learning • Agent-Based Modeling Selected Publications For a complete list of published and submitted paper, please visit the publication page of CSUN .
