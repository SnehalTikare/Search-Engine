She blends her politics, activism, and art into projects that are designed to inspire others to take action, think, discuss, engage with democracy and their community, and find some digital/analog balance. She is the instigator behind #RitasQuilt and @BadassHerstory. She teaches at Columbia College and is founder of Seriously Badass Women. Her life motto is: Make Art. Smash Systems.
