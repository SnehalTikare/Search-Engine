Hair is also about community. UIC’s Women’s Leadership and Resource Center and Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life invite Black women students to participate in a collaborative art project that explores the stories that Black women tell about their hair. Over the Spring 2020 semester, each participant will work with a fiber artist to design and stitch an individual quilt square while learning about Black women’s quilting traditions and engaging in conversation about what love, joy, family, politics, trauma, fashion, and resistance have to do with Black hair. The workshop sessions will be led by Dorothy Burge, African American quilter, fiber artist, Chicago community activist, and UIC alum. Thursdays, 3:00-5:00pm Dates: April 2, April 16, April 30 Email UICBlackHairQuilt@gmail.com to register and receive Zoom login information.
