These internships will have a duration of three to six months. These internships are intended to provide diverse and illuminating experiences in environments different from that of a U.S. research university. Students will gain an understanding of global security and privacy issues; they will be exposed to alternative career paths and international variations in research infrastructure and culture; and will establish professional contacts outside the U.S. The ESP IGERT currently provides two such opportunities with associated international partners: (a) Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, (b) National University of Singapore. Politecnico di Milano Situated in the north of Italy, the Politecnico di Milano is among the top engineering schools in Italy and Europe. IGERT fellows will have the opportunity to work for three up to six months at the VPLAB group in collaboration with Professor Stefano Zanero . National University of Singapore The National University of Singapore is among the top engineering schools in Asia. IGERT fellows will have the opportunity to work for three up to six months at the Information Security Research Group in collaboration with Professor Zhenkai Liang .
