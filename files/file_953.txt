John Marshall’s International Human Rights Clinic was a co-organizer of the conference. The event, Universal Periodic Review Town Hall Meeting, covered a brief overview of the Universal Periodic Review, which is a United Nations process whereby countries are evaluated on their human rights practices. Professor Michael Seng, co-director of John Marshall’s Restorative Justice Project and director of the John Marshall Fair Housing Legal Support Center, spoke as part of the sustainable development panel. His presentation focused on the importance of restorative justice, particularly when applied to discrimination, torture and violence. “What we often do not recognize is the role of the community,” Seng said. “Holding the community responsible and making the community a part of the process is one of the reasons restorative justice can be so effective.” Representatives from the U.S. Human Rights Network, the EPA, UNICEF, Windy City Times, the U.S. Department of Justice and more were on-hand at the day-long event. Their presentations discussed issues such as what can be done about the growing number of prison inmates who suffer from mental illness; how Chicago can fix its issues regarding police brutality and torture; what it will take to ensure all citizens have access to clean water in the U.S.; and what can be done to stop human trafficking. “We were thrilled to partner with UNA-USA Chicago, which plays a key role in promoting continued U.S. engagement with the UN,” said Sarah Davila-Ruhaak, co-founder and director of the International Human Rights Clinic at John Marshall. “We hope that this conference served as a platform for local activists to share thoughts and experiences on various issues in human rights.” John Marshall’s International Human Rights Clinic promotes human rights domestically and around the world by providing direct legal representation to clients and organizations in international and domestic forums; documenting human rights violations in the United States and abroad; collaborating with other human rights organizations on cases and projects; and publishing and presenting reports, papers and other materials related to human rights.
