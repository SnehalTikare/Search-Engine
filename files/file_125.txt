SWE is a great support system for all engineering students at UIC! We coordinate many events throughout the academic year that range from attending conferences to conducting outreach events for elementary school students. We focus on academic and professional development so our fellow students feel prepared for graduate school and/or the workforce. We also strive to provide our members with many resources to strengthen their leadership and communication skills which are also vital skills for any career! We hope to see you at our future events!
