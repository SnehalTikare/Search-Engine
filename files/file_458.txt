UIC social media accounts must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Public
and Government Affairs. PGA’s goal is
to provide counsel and support campus social media managers and page
administrators to use social media channels as effectively as possible to reach
audiences and uphold the reputation of UIC. PGA will routinely review all
UIC-affiliated social media pages to ensure they adhere to PGA’s social media
policies and guidelines and will reach out to social media managers as needed
to discuss solutions for pages that need support. Each new page will be under review for the first six months of its existence to ensure that it conforms to our policies and guidelines. Please fill out
