Date / Time April 9, 2020  - April 30, 2020 All Day Categories Featured Sustainability This year’s Earth Day will be special for more than one reason: not only will it be the 50th anniversary of the event, but it will also be UIC’s first-ever virtual Earth Day! While we wish we could come together physically for a day of activism and action, we nevertheless hope to see you join us (virtually) in support of a Plastic-Free UIC. In honor of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, we want the UIC community — wherever you are —  to participate in this year’s virtual Earth Day events throughout the month of April. Please join your fellow UIC students, faculty, and staff in our virtual “clean up” via the Litterati app, and develop a zero-waste policy for your department, unit, student organization or residence hall. While sharing your support for a plastic-free university on social media, we also encourage you to wear red instead of green. Besides showing some UIC-colored pride for the Zero Waste accomplishments we’ve made so far, we’re sounding the alarm on the climate crisis. Share your support for a Plastic-Free UIC. We hope you’ll join us in virtual support of a healthier, safer, and more sustainable planet. Please visit our Earth Day webpage for more information .
