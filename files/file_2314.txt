    financial engineering Welcome from the Lab Director Professor Derong Liu Mission Statement and Project Descriptions People from the Laboratory Research Support Useful Links Welcome from Professor Derong Liu Welcome to the Computational Intelligence Laboratory (CIL) in
the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois near downtown Chicago, Illinois.
This laboratory was established in August 1999.
The purpose of setting up such a laboratory
is to provide a lab that supports a research program which strives to bring
together the results of academic research in
the field of computational intelligence and the problems encountered in
engineering practice. If you have any questions,
comments, or suggestions, please send e-mail to dliu@ece.uic.edu . Computational Intelligence Laboratory (CIL) The mission of CIL is to develop
methods, tools, and technology
for the design and implementation of learning systems which mimic
the learning process of humans, and apply them to real world problems.
The goal is to solve complex engineering problems
which are difficult to deal with using conventional approaches.
Current application areas include traffic control/management in telecommunication networks
    and learning control methodologies for automotive engines,
 among others.
The emphasis in CIL is on collaboration with
researchers and practitioners from academia and industry.

Some of the current projects in the laboratory are: Computational Intelligence Click here Computational intelligence combines elements of learning, adaptation, evolution and
fuzzy logic (rough sets) to create systemss that are, in some sense, intelligent.
Our research covers neural
networks, fuzzy systems and evolutionary computation, including swarm intelligence,
as well as their applications. Computational Neuroscience Click here Intelligent Control and Learning Control Click here Click here Click here Click here Book | Book | Book | Book Our current interest in this field is
    neural network-based approaches for intelligent systems and learning control.
    In particular, our study is focused on neural network-based
    adaptive critic designs. Adaptive critic designs are designs
    that approximate dynamic
       programming in the general case, i.e., approximate optimal control
    over time in noisy, nonlinear environments. There are many practical
       problems that can be formulated as to minimize or maximize
    a measure of cost.
    It is well-known that dynamic programming is very useful in
    solving these problems.
       However, it is often computationally untenable to run true dynamic
    programming due to the backward numerical process required for its
       solutions, i.e., due to the "curse of dimensionality."
    Over the years, progress has been made to circumvent the
    "curse of dimensionality" by
       building a system, called "critic" to approximate the cost
    function in dynamic programming. The idea is to approximate dynamic
       programming solutions by using a function approximation structure
    such as neural networks to approximate the cost function.
    Our work includes methodology
    development and applications of adaptive
       critic designs to automotive engine control. Click here for publications This laboratory contains
