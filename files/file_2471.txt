College of Nursing Diversity Strategic Plan: Goals and Strategies The University of Illinois at Chicago defines diversity as, “the totality of the ways people are similar and different, including race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation and identity, disability, national origin and citizenship status, age, language, culture, religion, and economic status, particularly when those similarities and differences are used as a basis for unfair advantage and inequity.”  The goals in our diversity strategic plan are based on multiple sources of data including the College of Nursing Diversity Strategic Thinking document and the university document, “Through the Lens of Diversity.” Download "College of Nursing Diversity Strategic Plan" Links to other aspects of diversity Have a comment about our climate?
