If you are teaching asynchronously, please make yourself available to students during the regularly scheduled time. If you are delivering your lectures at the regularly scheduled class time, it will also be helpful for the students if they can get the lectures asynchronously (i.e., at other times in the day). Some of our students have returned home to other parts of the world and requiring them to watch a lecture at 3 a.m. is difficult. Also, some students might experience localized technical difficulties, or we may even experience at times some wide-scale interruptions. These sorts of issues can be greatly alleviated if we are offering asynchronous content delivery.‚Äù Teaching Online Recommended resources for online teaching and office hours.

Simply join the room and you are online; just remember to show up on time! Scheduling a Session has some advantages: for example, you can have a Session even without you. Students can join and start presenting right away, and the session can be automatically recorded. How long does it take for a Blackboard Collaborate recording to publish?

Tips and Helpful Links Best Practices practices Good audio : Having good audio is crucial to minimize breaks in your voice. Use a microphone headset or any microphone/headphone combination you already have, including AirPods. Laptops often have the microphone close to the speakers, creating a loop that will cause breaks in sound for the listener. Another pathway to fixing this when you lecture is to lower your speaker volume, be in a quiet room, and stay close to the laptop mic. Dial-in numbers are a great way to bypass computer audio issues. However, with increased demand, some services are reporting issues. Turn off video camera : The only time you should use a camera is to say hi! The rest of the time should be audio and screen share. Mute everyone else when you are lecturing. Listeners‚Äô microphones will pick up background noises and create breaks in your lecture. Share your screen : Don‚Äôt forget to share your entire screen instead of individual applications. This makes it easier to swap between windows when you teach with multiple media.

Internet Safety safety A few steps to help protect yourself from online threats ‚Ä¶ Accounts and passwords ‚Äì Regardless of how authentic an email may seem, if you have any doubt, you can always forward it to the College IT staff or to security@uic.edu to confirm. Examples of potentially suspicious topics include password-change emails, requests for billing information, and warnings that your account is about to be deactivated. If you see anything odd, let us know. üòâ Email spoofing ‚Äì All too familiar in the past couple of years, spoofing emails ‚Äúlook‚Äù like they are coming from people you know, but they are attacks in the hope that you will reply. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to prevent such attacks. General information about our faculty and staff‚Äîsuch as your name, email, and potentially your supervisor‚Äôs name‚Äîis publicly available on UIC websites and can easily be used to write a convincing email. Anyone can go to a legitimate email service (such as gmail, yahoo) and create an address that looks almost like the real person‚Äôs email. Often the message you receive will ask you to purchase something (such as gift cards) and email the information or serial numbers to the requestor, who appears to be your department head or supervisor. Here are a few tips to spot a spoof when the email just seems odd: Don‚Äôt reply! Check for inconsistencies such as the email address, the signature, and context. Always look at the actual email address‚Äînot the displayed name‚Äîto confirm who sent the email. You may have to expand the ‚Äúsent from‚Äù field to even see this. This can be difficult with email clients on Smartwatch screens, mobile phones, or even desktops (which may just display the name, not the actual email address‚Äîand it‚Äôs the email address itself that will tip you off that this isn‚Äôt from whom you think). Be careful when drafting a fresh email to the real person. If you replied to the spoofed email, your email software might grab the spoofed address and save it to your address book. Be sure to delete it. Learn more about email spoofing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing .
