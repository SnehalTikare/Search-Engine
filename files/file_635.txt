For decades, UIC’s 28-story University Hall has been home to a peregrine falcon family nesting on its ledges. Once an endangered species, the falcons have made a dramatic comeback in the Midwest since Chicago Peregrine Release placed the first chicks atop University Hall in 1986. The falcons may be the fastest animals in the world — a diving falcon was clocked at 242 miles per hour. To see UIC’s resident raptors, look to the skies!
